Guangdong province is set to promote successful customs experiences in certain areas, including the use of remote visualization for investigation and inspection, a new mode in cargo collection and flight, joint customs inspection, and more, among a batch of successful cases in other sectors.
The remote visualization for investigation and inspection will be promoted in areas excluding Shenzhen. A nationwide cargo collection—comprehensive bonded area consolidation—airport direct flight and cross-customs area bonded exhibition and trade is to be promoted in special customs supervision areas, and the implementation of cooperative inspection in health quarantine will be promoted at border checkpoints connected to Macao.
These successful cases are among the ninth batch of innovative experiences to be replicated and promoted from the China (Guangdong) Pilot Free Trade Zone (GDFTZ), released by Guangdong Province. Apart from the above-mentioned experiences, the notice highlights 16 other cases of innovative experiences in fields such as investment and trade facilitation, legal system construction, and government function transformation, which will be replicated and promoted across the province.
These efforts reflect Guangdong's commitment to continuous reform and innovation, aiming to create a more favorable business environment and promote sustainable economic growth.
Investmentand tradefacilitation
The notice includes three reform measures aimed at enhancing investment facilitation. These include a one-stop service for land delivery and real estate registration, the integration of construction project acceptance and registration, and more in-depth market-oriented allocation of data elements.
Seven trade facilitation measures are also highlighted. These encompass direct exit border inspection procedures for newly built or repaired international navigation vessels, optimized border inspection and customs clearance for international navigation vessels carrying vehicles, the establishment of a nearby vessel audit mechanism, cross-border recognition of electronic maritime certificates, simplified application procedures for Hong Kong and Macao yachts, a new regulatory model for chilled aquatic products supplied to Macao, and a new intelligent inspection model for small passenger cars. These reforms aim to simplify and expedite trade-related procedures, enhancing the province's trade efficiency.
Legal systemconstructionandgovernment function transformation
Four legal system construction measures are proposed. These include the exploration of diversified dispute resolution mechanisms through offer and settlement procedures, the implementation of a system where Hong Kong residents serve as supervisors in hearings, the establishment of a technical investigation officer system for administrative law enforcement on intellectual property rights, and the innovation of a fast-track pre-examination mechanism for overseas patents.
These measures are intended to strengthen the legal framework and protect intellectual property rights, fostering a more conducive environment for innovation and business.
Two measures focus on transforming government functions. These include the construction of a digital RMB cross-border tax payment channel and a digital tax risk control model, aiming to modernize government services and enhance tax administration efficiency.
The replication and promotion of these innovative experiences are expected to enhance the spillovers of the GDFTZ, driving high-quality economic development across the province and elevating Guangdong's position in international economic cooperation and competition.
