On January 14, an exhibition on inkstone culture and examples unearthed in Guangdong was launched in the province's capital, Guangzhou.
The Southern Han Mausoleums Museum is showing 276 pieces and sets of artifacts, including inkstones and traditional Chinese writing materials from museums in Guangdong and Tianjin.
The inkstones date back to the time between the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) and the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
Masters are on site to demonstrate inkstone-making techniques and interact with museum visitors.
In Chinese culture, the inkstone, together with ink, paper and brush, make the "Four Treasures of Study".
The exhibition will last until May 19.
