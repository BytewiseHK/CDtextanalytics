The Chinese New Year in 2025, which falls on January 29, welcomes the Year of the Snake, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. In Guangzhou, when it comes to the festive atmosphere of Chinese New Year, shopping on the streets is an essential part of it. Yide Lu is undoubtedly one of the top choices for many locals to buy New Year goods. Here, you can find everything from couplets, decorations, toys, nuts, sweets, to all kinds of cooking ingredients for the New Year's Eve reunion dinner.
Yide Lu is a typical historic commercial street running from east to west in Yuexiu district, Guangzhou. SilkRoadPost shows you what are the best choices for your shopping in Yide Lu.
New Year decorations
Red lanterns, snake figurines, couplets, Chinese knots, electric toys... A wide variety of New Year decorations are on display in Yide Lu. Some shopkeepers said business has been booming since the beginning of the month.
The festive atmosphere attracts many young people to take pictures. Besides locals, many foreigners also come to shop. An old lady from Singapore said: "I came to Guangzhou to travel and took the opportunity to buy some New Year goods to take back home, because it's more expensive to buy them in Singapore."
A buyer from Bangladesh also said: "We come to Yide Lu for wholesale purchases. And we will buy some toys and decorations that are reasonably priced."
Dried food
In addition to New Year decorations, Yide Lu offers a full range of dried seafood, snacks, nuts and other items for New Year celebrations. After exiting Exit A of Yide Lu metro station (Line 6), you will find such shops scattered throughout the streets and alleys of the Yide Lu area.
