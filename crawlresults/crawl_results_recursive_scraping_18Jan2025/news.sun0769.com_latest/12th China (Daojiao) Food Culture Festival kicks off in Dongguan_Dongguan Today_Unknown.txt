Visitors will have the opportunity to savor unique flavors from various regions, including those from Meizhou, Shantou, Shaoguan, Yangjiang, Shanwei, Yunfu, and Jieyang.
The festival features 11 dedicated food zones with nearly 300 upscale food stalls, along with exciting side events such as a live-streaming sales competition, a Daojiao handmade meatball demonstration, youth talent performances, and a "Top Ten Popular Merchants" selection.
This year's festival promises a rich variety of recreational activities, allowing visitors to enjoy exhibitions, culinary pleasures, and entertainment simultaneously. Returning highlights from last year include popular performances such as Yingge Dance, Tang Dynasty acrobatics, and contemporary music concerts. Additional festivities will include a welcoming parade for the God of Wealth, a scholar procession, Hanfu shows, iron flower displays, drone shows, and cold flame fireworks, creating a festive atmosphere for the New Year celebration.
