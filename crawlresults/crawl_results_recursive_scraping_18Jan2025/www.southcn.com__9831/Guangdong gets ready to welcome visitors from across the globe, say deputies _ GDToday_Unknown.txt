Search for "China" and "travel" on platforms like YouTube, and you'll find a flood of vlogs showcasing the country's charm. Many of these videos, filmed in 2024, have garnered millions of views, reflecting a growing global fascination with China.
This surge in interest aligns with China's efforts to expand visa-free policies and streamline payment systems for international visitors. For instance, tourism is thrivingâ€”Guangdong welcomed over 800 million tourists in 2024, including an impressive 87 percent increase in foreign visitors.
At the same time, Chinese social media platforms are buzzing with cultural exchanges. Many foreigners, dubbing themselves "TikTok refugees," are flocking to the platform RedNote, where they connect with locals, share cultural experiences, and even learn Chinese.
The big question is: How can China sustain this momentum and turn such popularity into lasting relationships? What can be done to further enhance the travel experience for international visitors? And which hidden gems do locals recommend?
To explore these questions, we spoke with deputies from the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress. They shared their vision for how Guangdong is transforming into a global tourism hotspot and what's next for visitors eager to experience the region's unique appeal.
