The third session of the 14th Guangdong Provincial People's Congress kicked off in Guangzhou on January 15, where the 2025 Guangdong Government Work Report underscored the ongoing integration of Hengqin and Macao as a key focus for driving high-quality development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).
The report highlighted the significant progress made in 2024, including the implementation of more convenient travel policies between Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hengqin, and Hong Kong/Macao. The full closed-loop operation of the island, along with the increasing number of Macao residents living and working in Hengqin, has led to a 44% rise in Macao-backed companies, now surpassing 6,600. All of these developments underscore the completion of the first phase of the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, marking a significant milestone in the region's integration process.
Furthermore, the share of “four new industries” in Hengqin (High-end Manufacturing and Technological R&D; Macao-branded Industries, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); Cultural Tourism, Convention and Exhibition & Trade; Modern Financial Services) has reached 55%, positioning “Macao + Hengqin” as a model for deepening “One Country, Two Systems” and a key platform for advancing China's high-level opening up to the world.
Looking toward 2025, which marks the beginning of the second phase of the cooperation zone's development, the government reaffirmed Hengqin's original purpose of supporting Macao's moderate economic diversification. It also stressed the importance of improving infrastructure, regulatory systems, and strengthening ties between the people of Hengqin and Macao.
