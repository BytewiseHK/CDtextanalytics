Also known as “Xin’an Old Town," this historical site north of Nantou Footbridge in Nanshan District was first built in 331 A.D. during the East Jin Dynasty (317-420). Having witnessed nearly 1,700 years of change, Nantou Ancient Town is considered to represent the cultural roots of both Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
It once served as an administrative center and significant coastal fortress as well as a hub of sea transportation and foreign trade. Surrounded by trenches in a roughly rectangular foundation built with a type of red clay, it measures 680 meters from east to west and 500 meters from north to south at its widest. The foundations of the walls on the north and south are well preserved, as is the southern gate, with an inscription on top bearing the Chinese characters “宁南” (meaning “Peace in the South”) in seal script.
At least a dozen historical sites in the ancient town are worth a visit, including the Xin’an Prefectural Office.
