*Sugar BarFuhua 3 Rd. Coco Park L3 (Gowugongyuan Subway Station)福田区福华三路星河Coco Park L3楼 （地铁购物公园站）(0755) 8290 3234First impressions: New venue inside Coco park so location is convenient but upon first entry it feels a little cold while the DJ is up too high and first impression of the music is so so.
