Zhang YuJeniZhang13@163.comCONTRACT electronics giant Foxconn and Shenzhen-based humanoid robot manufacturer UBTECH Robotics announced yesterday the establishment of a comprehensive long-term strategic partnership, a landmark collaboration aimed at revolutionizing the landscape of intelligent manufacturing.The partnership will involve both companies conducting rigorous testing and driving technological innovation of humanoid robots in manufacturing environments, aiming to promote the widespread adoption of these robots across Foxconn’s diverse intelligent manufacturing scenarios.Under the terms of the agreement, Foxconn and UBTECH will work hand-in-hand to validate the feasibility of humanoid robots in intelligent manufacturing. They will co-create pilot application scenarios tailored to Foxconn’s current operational needs.UBTECH will lead the selection of application scenarios and analysis of technical applicability, focusing on tasks such as handling, sorting, gluing, quality inspection, and operations that could impact the health of laborers.The two companies are also set to launch a joint research and development project aimed at the large-scale application of humanoid robots and establish a joint laboratory dedicated to humanoid robot research in intelligent manufacturing.In a show of exclusivity, Foxconn has named UBTECH as its sole humanoid robot partner, as revealed in the agreement.According to UBTECH, its industrial humanoid robot Walker S1 has already completed a two-month training program at Foxconn’s factory in Longhua District.UBTECH’s industrial humanoid robot will enter the next phase of training at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory in Henan Province, furthering the practical application of these advanced robots in manufacturing.This partnership with Foxconn marks another significant milestone for UBTECH, following successful collaborations with industry titans such as BYD, Geely Auto, Audi FAW, FAW-Volkswagen Qingdao Branch, and SF Express.
