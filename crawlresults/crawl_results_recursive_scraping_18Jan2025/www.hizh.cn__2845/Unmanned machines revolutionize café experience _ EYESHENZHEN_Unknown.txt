Spanning approximately 150 square meters and accommodating 80 seating spaces, Kafa Coffee features three state-of-the-art unmanned coffee machines. These advanced systems boast capabilities such as grinding, icing, brewing, sealing, and intelligent selection, ensuring a precise and efficient transformation of freshly ground beans into a tantalizing brew with each cup.

At the heart of this technological revolution lies Kafa Coffee’s integration of internet, big data, and artificial intelligence, setting a new benchmark in the freshly ground coffee industry. By sourcing premium Arabica coffee beans from Ethiopia and top-tier milk from New Zealand, customers can not only customize the strength of their coffee to suit personal preferences but also indulge in a touchless, swift, and health-conscious process.
During the opening period, patrons flocked to experience the high-tech coffee offerings. The focal point of delight was the striking intelligent ordering screen, simplifying the selection and ordering process for beverages, snacks, and fruits with a mere touch.

The café’s interior design exudes comfort and warmth, blending minimalist and chic elements to create a serene ambiance for relaxation. Whether seeking animated conversations with friends or moments of solitude, the café caters to a diverse range of customer preferences.

Since its establishment in Shenzhen last March, Kafa Coffee has leveraged its fully automatic unmanned coffee machine to lead a surge in the nationwide self-service coffee market. With an impressive deployment rate of over 1,000 coffee machines monthly, the company has expanded its presence to encompass subsidiaries in about 10 cities nationwide.
“The rapid growth has surpassed our expectations,” remarked Su Hua, chairman of Kafa Coffee. “Kafa Coffee has ventured into parks, hospitals, schools, office buildings, and other settings, bridging the gap for consumers to savor a freshly brewed cup of coffee conveniently.”
