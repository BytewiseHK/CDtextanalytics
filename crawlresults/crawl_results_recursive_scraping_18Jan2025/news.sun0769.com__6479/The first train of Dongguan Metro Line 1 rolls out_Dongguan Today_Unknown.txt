On December 23, the first train for Dongguan Metro Line 1 Phase I was officially completed and unveiled at CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co., Ltd. This marks a key step in the progress of the long-awaited metro line.
The train is a state-of-the-art B-type vehicle developed to GoA4, the highest grade of automation for driverless systems. It features a 6-car configuration with 4 powered cars and 2 trailers, offering a maximum speed of 120 km/h and a passenger capacity of over 2,000 people. The train boasts advanced features such as automatic operation, diagnostics, precise parking, and obstacle detection. Its energy-efficient design uses permanent magnet traction technology to reduce carbon emissions.
The exterior and interior of the train are primarily cobalt blue, with optimized systems for lighting, air conditioning, braking, and passenger interaction to improve both efficiency and comfort.
The train will undergo comprehensive testing at the CRRC Nanjing Puzhen facility, including traction, braking, and pantograph trials. Once testing is completed, the train will be transported to the Daojiao Depot of Dongguan Metro Line 1, where it will continue preparation for its debut.
With this significant milestone, Dongguan Metro Line 1 is one step closer to becoming fully operational, promising an efficient and sustainable transportation option for the city's residents.
