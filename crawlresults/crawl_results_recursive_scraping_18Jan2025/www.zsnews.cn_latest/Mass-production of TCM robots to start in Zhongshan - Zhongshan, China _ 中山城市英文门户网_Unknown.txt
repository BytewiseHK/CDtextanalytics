One can make a diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine by standing in front of the machine. The prescription made by the machine is highly consistent with that of senior TCM experts. From a prescription to a steaming cup of medicine, it takes only 5 minutes to complete.
These seemingly sci-fi scenes are being turned into reality through the efforts of Professor Hon Chitin and his team from the Macau University of Science and Technology.
In 2021, commissioned by the Guangdong Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Macau University of Science and Technology, Professor Hon and a dozen experts started the research on the intelligence of traditional Chinese medicine.
After three years of efforts, the team has developed a TCM robot with the utilization of big data and artificial intelligence, which realizes the automated and intelligent process of TCM diagnosis and treatment.
Professor Hon's team also joins hands with Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine and Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine to enhance the overall performance of the TCM robot.
Currently, the Singou industrial park, which is mainly for the production of TCM robots, has officially landed in Zhongshan and will go into full operation this year.
Located in Cuiheng New District, the Singou industrial park is the production base of TCM robots, with a predicted output of 500 to 1,000 units per year.
