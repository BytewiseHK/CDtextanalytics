Taiwan unveils a home-grown ‘kamikaze’ portable attack drone
The official military newspaper, The PLA Daily, has reported on some of these drills, the most recent being carried out in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.
Another article in May highlighted some of the technology being studied, including Britain’s DragonFire, a high-powered laser weapon that was successfully tested in January.
The military has also published regular articles about the use of the technology in conflicts such as Ukraine and Gaza.
One article in June argued that “through the study of local wars in recent years, it is found that foreign militaries usually adopt detection, electronic jamming … and other means to implement anti-UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] operations, and often achieve good results”.
