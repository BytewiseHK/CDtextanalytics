Li Daokui of Tsinghua University says Chinese manufacturers eyeing Vietnam as a point of entry to the US should ‘reconsider’ in light of tariffs
Chinese enterprises hoping to use Southeast Asia as a back door into the US market will have to reassess their investment strategies, a former central bank adviser warned, saying US president-elect Donald Trump “will certainly escalate tariffs” on shipments originating there.
“It’s fine if your company wants to cater to local demands, such as the Vietnamese market, which boasts good potential for economic growth and domestic consumption,” said Li, who paid a visit to Vietnam in late November.
Li is also a former member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the country’s top political advisory body.
“However, if your aim is to export to the US via entrepot, then you may have to reconsider,” he warned.
