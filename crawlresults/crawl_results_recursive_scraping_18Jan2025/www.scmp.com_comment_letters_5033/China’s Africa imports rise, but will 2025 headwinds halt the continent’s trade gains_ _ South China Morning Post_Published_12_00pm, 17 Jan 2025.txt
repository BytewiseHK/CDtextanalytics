Boost in commodities demand helps narrow Africa’s China trade deficit as nations urge more imports of processed goods
China’s imports from Africa rose to US$116.8 billion last year, up 6.9 per cent compared to 2023, driven by gold demand and agricultural products, which slightly narrowed the continent’s trade deficit.
The increase tapered Africa’s trade gap with China to about US$62 billion from US$64 billion in 2023, according to statistics from the General Administration of Customs, as African countries called for more imports of their processed products, rather than raw materials.
