Measures by Thai authorities to protect visitors – including those from Hong Kong – by heading off sham offers of lucrative work a welcome step
The expression too good to be true seems apt for job offers in a cross-border scam that turned out to be forced labour. But the scam has ultimately resulted in efforts by the Hong Kong and Thai governments to help Chinese victims, and warnings from Chinese embassies to compatriots who might be tempted by fake opportunities.
A Hong Kong government mission to Thailand to help rescue a dozen Hongkongers aged 21 to 43 has returned without them, although Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said it received a positive response and that the government was now tapping international connections such as Interpol. Task force leader, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk Hau-yip, says Thai authorities are expected to roll out measures to ensure visitors’ safety.
These should include decisive steps to bring the Hongkongers home unharmed. Thai authorities may be mindful of territorial sensitivities arising from the involvement of neighbouring countries in the criminal syndicate operations, but Thailand is, after all, a key transit link in the recruitment process.
Humanitarian reasons and law enforcement aside, Thailand needs to be mindful also of the impact on its tourist industry – a pillar of its economy – of negative perceptions of traveller safety. Testament to that are warnings from Chinese embassies in Thailand and Myanmar to their citizens to beware of recruitment scams offering high pay overseas.
