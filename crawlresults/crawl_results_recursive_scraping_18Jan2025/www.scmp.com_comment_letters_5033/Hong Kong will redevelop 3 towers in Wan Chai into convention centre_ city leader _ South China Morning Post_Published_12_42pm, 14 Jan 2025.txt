The tower, one of three buildings at a government office compound in Wan Chai, was previously expected to be vacated by the end of 2027. It will be rebuilt into a new complex that will add 30,000 square metres (322,917 sq ft) of floor space for conventions and trade fairs as well as about 500 hotel rooms by 2034.
“But it is important for the government to make good use of resources, so while the redevelopment plan will go ahead, the buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them,” he said.
“That is why we are now renovating the [office] there so as to allow the former chief executive to move in. That will save government money and also ensure government resources are properly utilised.”
