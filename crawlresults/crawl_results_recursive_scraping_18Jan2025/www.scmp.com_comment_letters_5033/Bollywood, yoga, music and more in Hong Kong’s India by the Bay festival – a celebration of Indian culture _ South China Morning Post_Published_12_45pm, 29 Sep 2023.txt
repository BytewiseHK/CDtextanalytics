India has one of the world’s most ancient civilisations, and a rich cultural heritage seen in, among other things, philosophy, food and dance.
“It’s true that much of what is known about India in places such as Hong Kong is Bollywood driven, because that is the popular culture,” says Sanjoy Roy of Delhi-based entertainment company Teamwork Arts.
Broadening people’s view of Indian culture is what Teamwork Arts does best, and it does this by presenting India-focused festivals in the rest of the world. That includes Hong Kong, where it will host India by the Bay from October 7-15.
Bollywood fans have not been forgotten. A festival highlight is “Bollywood Love Story – A Musical Theatrical Extravaganza”, in which song and dance from the screen have been reinterpreted in a vibrant stage spectacle that will light up the Xiqu Centre in the West Kowloon Cultural District on October 14.
