Many rightly questioned why the bus, which crashed at about 2.40am, had been allowed to transport people at such an ungodly hour, as China’s traffic laws apparently forbid long-distance passenger buses from being on the road between 2am and 5am.
Others lamented that such a tragedy could have happened anywhere in the country, as officials at all levels remain hell-bent on eliminating cases at any cost in pursuit of the fanciful goal of “societal zero-Covid” – which basically means that new infections should be contained among people already under quarantine so the virus is no longer spreading at the community level.
