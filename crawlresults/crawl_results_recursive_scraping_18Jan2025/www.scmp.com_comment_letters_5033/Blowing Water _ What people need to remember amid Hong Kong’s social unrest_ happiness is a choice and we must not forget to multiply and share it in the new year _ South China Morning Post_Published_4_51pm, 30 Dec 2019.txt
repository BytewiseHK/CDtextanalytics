An early Happy New Year to you all!
Sadly, happiness has been a rather distant goal for most Hongkongers in the past six months while the city continues to be rocked by violence and vandalism with its future hanging in the balance.
Ask any Hongkonger what they would want most in 2020 or to choose one thing they would like to improve on in the new year; many would most likely say – happiness.
In most of the decisions we make in life or things we do or pursue, we, knowingly or not, aim to achieve happiness as the ultimate goal. So, if you are asked what is more important to you, happiness or success, either answer is the same. It is because they are the same thing; let me explain why.
I often assess how well a year has turned out by measuring how happy I have been throughout that year. Sometimes it means going beyond the physical rewards of achievements or material gains such as a job promotion or an expensive gift, and focusing more on what a certain decision, effort, or outcome has brought, such as a sense of well-being, contentment, hence happiness.
