Hong Kong authorities have come under renewed pressure to ensure the return of residents believed to be held captive in the region
The Post breaks down when kidnappings started, how the government has responded, and what residents can do to protect themselves.
In July 2022, the government revealed that some residents had been deceived into travelling to Southeast Asia, where they were forced to take part in scams.
The individuals were held captive, with one of the locations being the notorious “KK Park”, a Chinese-run “fraud factory” at the Myanmar-Thailand border where thousands of forced labourers were detained.
That year, the Security Bureau launched a dedicated task force to coordinate the rescue efforts of residents trapped in such scams.
Between 2022 and early 2023, the government received 46 requests for help from Hongkongers trapped in compounds in Myanmar and Cambodia.
