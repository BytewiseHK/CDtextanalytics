Readers discuss reforming the city’s exam-oriented system, the lack of sleep among schoolchildren, and claw machines covering up illicit gambling
In criticising native English teachers, your correspondent has actually held up a mirror to Hong Kong education and, in particular, how English is taught here.
Of course, I am very grateful for the high salary and while your correspondent questions it, I can give an assurance that it is what keeps native English teachers in position. In six years on the scheme, every native English teacher I met claimed to be staying for the money and at best professed tolerance of their job, rather than satisfaction.
Those who wanted to develop their careers and professional learning, like me, have since moved on. Your correspondent’s call for “fresh blood” on the scheme is misleading because change is needed across the board, from initial teacher training to school governance to curriculum to assessment of teaching and learning.
