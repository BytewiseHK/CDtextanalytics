Foshan Haitian Flavouring, CATL are among mainland industry leaders planning billion-dollar IPOs as China deepens market connectivity
More jumbo stock offerings from some of China’s biggest onshore-listed companies are making their way to Hong Kong, supported by demand from global funds, improved valuations and market reforms, according to the nation’s biggest investment bank.
“Some leading A-share companies with a large market capitalisation in various industries [are looking] to issue H shares, which could attract some international long-term funds and institutional investors,” said Xu Jia, deputy head of the investment banking department at China International Capital Corporation (CICC).
China’s biggest condiment maker Foshan Haitian Flavouring and Food submitted an application on Monday to list its shares. It has selected CICC, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint sponsors, with media reports suggesting the Shanghai-listed firm was looking to raise at least US$1.5 billion.
