Luigi Mangione’s fingerprints also matched those on a water bottle near where United Healthcare’s Brian Thompson was killed
The gun found on the suspect in the killing of United Healthcare’s CEO matched shell casings found at the site of the shooting, New York’s police commissioner said on Wednesday.
Suspect Luigi Mangione’s fingerprints also matched a water bottle and a protein bar wrapper that police found near the scene and that officials say the gunman bought at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference.
The 26-year-old Mangione’s was charged with murder in the shooting last week in midtown Manhattan of Brian Thompson, who led the United States’ largest medical insurance company.
Authorities have said that writings found in Mangione’s possession hinted at a hatred of corporate greed.
They have recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a three-page handwritten letter found when he was arrested, a law enforcement official said on Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was in the notebook.
The letter, found when Mangione was arrested on Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, teased the possibility that clues to the attack – “some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it” – could be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said.
