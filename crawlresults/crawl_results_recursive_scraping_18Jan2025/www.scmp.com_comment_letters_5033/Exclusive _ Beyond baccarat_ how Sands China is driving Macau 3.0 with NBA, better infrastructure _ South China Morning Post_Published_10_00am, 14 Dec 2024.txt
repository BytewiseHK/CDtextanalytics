How Sands China is driving ‘Macau 3.0’ with NBA Legends, better infrastructure
Sands China and its competitors – Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment, MGM China, Melco Resorts and SJM Holdings – are also upgrading high-end casino areas and planning entertainment events.
What sets Sands China apart from its competitors, according to president and CEO Grant Chum, is two decades of managing major non-gaming assets and businesses.
“We have deep experience in all of these non-gaming offerings and business pillars ranging from retail to entertainment, to food and drink to conventions [and] exhibitions,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Post. “It is not because we were told to, this is a core part of our business model. It is in our DNA.”
