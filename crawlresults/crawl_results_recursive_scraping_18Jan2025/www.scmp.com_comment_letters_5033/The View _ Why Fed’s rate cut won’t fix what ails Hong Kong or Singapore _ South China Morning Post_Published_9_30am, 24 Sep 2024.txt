Despite their many differences, Hong Kong and Singapore’s property markets both show that a monetary easing cycle is not a panacea
The Fed also signalled that more reductions would follow as it attempts to forestall a sharper slowdown in the US economy. The aggressive policy shift marks the beginning of a full-blown global monetary easing cycle as worries about inflation give way to concerns about growth.
The interest rate-sensitive property industry is seen as a prime beneficiary of the easing in monetary policy. Morgan Stanley said Hong Kong “is uniquely positioned to benefit from lower US rates”. Yet despite its relatively upbeat view of the city’s residential market, it expects house prices to grow just 5 per cent in 2025 following a projected decline of 8 per cent this year.
