The touristâ€™s jet ski collided with another on the holiday resort of Phuket
Authorities in Thailand are investigating the cause of a jet ski collision that killed a Chinese tourist in the holiday destination of Phuket on Tuesday.
The tourist was operating a jet ski near Patong Beach when it collided with another jet ski, also operated by a Chinese tourist, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
The second tourist sustained minor injuries, the report said.
A day earlier, a catamaran with 33 Chinese tourists on board capsized in Phuket. All passengers and crew members were rescued.
And last month, a Russian man died on the island after he was hit by a jet ski.
