Ex-media boss also says he paid ex-US general to advise the self-ruling island’s government
Former Hong Kong media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying has admitted to connecting three ex-US officials with the Taiwanese government to offer advice on foreign relations and strengthen ties with Washington, while denying claims he acted as a “middleman” to harm mainland China’s interests.
Lai also said on Thursday that he had relayed suggestions from two former United States officials to then Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen about the need to modernise the self-ruled island’s army, such as by hiring retired American generals to help put the military on track to secure up-to-date technologies.
Lai, 77, previously spent 26 days in the witness box contesting two conspiracy charges of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications.
They drew the court’s attention to Lai’s “very close” connections with former deputy US defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz and American army general Jack Keane, whom the tabloid founder described as his friends.
