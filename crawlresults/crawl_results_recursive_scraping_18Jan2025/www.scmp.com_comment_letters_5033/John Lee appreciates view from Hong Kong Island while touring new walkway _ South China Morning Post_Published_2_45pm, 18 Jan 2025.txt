Hong Kong’s leader jogs with youngsters and shares dessert with domestic helpers as he inspects new route under Island Eastern Corridor highway
Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has voiced his appreciation for Hong Kong Island’s views while touring a soon-to-open HK$1.7 billion (US$218.3 million) harbourfront boardwalk located underneath a major expressway.
The city leader also rode bicycles and jogged with a group of youngsters down the boardwalk below the Island Eastern Corridor on Saturday morning, greeting local residents at a seaside park as he stepped out in the company of the media and other city officials.
The HK$1.7 billion boardwalk took more than three years to build. The western half of the walkway will open on January 26, while the rest will become accessible in stages during the second half of the year.
“There are many places worth appreciating along the coast of Hong Kong Island,” he said while chatting with residents.
“The harbour scenery was really beautiful when we were walking along this section. We are usually too busy to appreciate it properly. So we often say that the longer you look at something, the more you appreciate it. We should cherish what we have around us.”
The promenade spans 2.2km (1.36 miles) and connects harbourfront walkways in Causeway Bay and Quarry Bay to create a 13km path along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island.
