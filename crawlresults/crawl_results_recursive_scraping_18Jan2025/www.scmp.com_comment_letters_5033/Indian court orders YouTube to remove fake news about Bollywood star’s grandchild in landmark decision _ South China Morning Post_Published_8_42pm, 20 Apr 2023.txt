The Delhi High Court on Thursday ordered YouTube to remove fake news videos about the granddaughter of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, in response to her petition to stop circulation of false rumours about her health, lawyers said.
Judge C. Hari Shankar ordered YouTube to ensure the videos about Aaradhya Bachchan, 11, were taken down immediately.
“Dissemination of misleading information about a child, especially as regards physical and mental health, is completely intolerable under the law,” the court said in its order.
Three lawyers representing Aaradhya said in a statement that it was a landmark judgment as the court has upheld the privacy of a child.
“Videos are false, fake, defamatory, and uploaded with the intent of gaining eyeballs … and subscription to the channel,” said Dayan Krishnan, one of the three lawyers.
Aaradhya is the daughter of actors Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and is frequently photographed accompanying them at public events.
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is a former Miss World and a brand ambassador for L’Oreal.
