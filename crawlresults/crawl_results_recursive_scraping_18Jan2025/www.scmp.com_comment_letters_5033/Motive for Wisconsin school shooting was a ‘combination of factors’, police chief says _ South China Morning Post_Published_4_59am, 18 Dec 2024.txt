The authenticity of a ‘manifesto’ said to be written by Natalie Rupnow, 15, who killed a teacher and fellow student, has not been confirmed
The motive for a shooting that killed a teacher and a student and wounded others at a Wisconsin school appears to be a “combination of factors”, a police chief said on Tuesday as he appealed to the public to share what they might know about the 15-year-old girl who attacked a study hall before shooting herself.
Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes offered no details about a possible motive, though he said bullying at Abundant Life Christian School would be investigated.
Barnes said police have not confirmed the authenticity of a “manifesto” that might have been written by Natalie Rupnow and could shed light on her actions.
“Identifying a motive is our top priority, but at this time it appears that the motive is a combination of factors,” the chief told reporters.
Barnes gave the number to a tip line for anyone who might have known the shooter and her feelings.
“There are always signs of a school shooting before it occurred. We’re looking into her online activity,” he said.
