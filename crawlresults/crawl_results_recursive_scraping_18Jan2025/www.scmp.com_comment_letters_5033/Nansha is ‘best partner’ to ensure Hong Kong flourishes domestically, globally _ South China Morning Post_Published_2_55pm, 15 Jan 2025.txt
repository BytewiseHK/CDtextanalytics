Top official notes municipal district’s development potential, given larger land area than Singapore, and support for Hong Kong youth
Nansha is poised to become Hong Kong’s “best partner” for building an overseas reputation and ensuring the financial hub flourishes under the country’s overall development plan, the municipal district’s top official has said at a flagship event hosted by the Post.
Liu Wei, the Communist Party’s chief in Nansha, also highlighted how the municipal district of Guangzhou supported Hong Kong’s young people, citing infrastructure that encouraged them to settle and establish start-ups there.
“Nansha has a history of collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau and is the chosen place to promote the integrated development of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau,” Liu told about 300 attendees at the South China Morning Post’s annual China Conference held in Nansha on Wednesday.
“The district is accelerating to become an important platform for Hong Kong and Macau to integrate into the nation’s overall national development and the best partner to establish overseas presence together.”
Nansha, about an hour’s drive from Hong Kong and only half an hour away by high-speed rail from all the major Greater Bay Area cities, is one of the three key development zones earmarked under the Greater Bay Area project. The other two are Qianhai in Shenzhen and Hengqin in Zhuhai.
The party chief on Wednesday noted that Nansha had great development potential as it had a land area of 803 sq km – 10 per cent larger than that of Singapore – but a development rate of only 27 per cent.
