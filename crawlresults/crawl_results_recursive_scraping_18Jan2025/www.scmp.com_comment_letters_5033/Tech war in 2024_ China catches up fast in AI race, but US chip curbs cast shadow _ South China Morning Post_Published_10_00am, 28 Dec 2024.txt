Abundant investment and an open-source approach have pushed China to the AI forefront, but a lack of advanced chips may prove devastating
“Whenever there’s a new product release, I’ll give it a try,” Shi said. If a certain tool impressed him, he would pay for a subscription.
Shi is among the many tech-savvy Chinese users spoiled by a bevy of home-grown generative AI (GenAI) services, as tech giants and cash-flush start-ups battle for customers in a fast-growing market. As of November, regulators had approved 252 GenAI services for public release in the country.
