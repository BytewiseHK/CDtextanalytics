Just how good can food scraps taste? That is what more than 200 guests attending the Rescued Feast at Soho House in Sheung Wan, on Hong Kong Island, were keen to find out.
According to the cityâ€™s Environmental Protection Department, 3,300 tonnes (3,600 tons) of food went into landfills every day in 2022 alone.
When we think of food waste, the image of expired goods in our fridges going into the bin often comes to mind, but one of the greatest sources of food waste is excess and unused inventory from the restaurant industry.
This is food that is not necessarily expired or gone bad, but sometimes comprises parts of ingredients that are not on the menu.
