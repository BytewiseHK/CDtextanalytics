Disappointed fans who hoped to watch Lionel Messi in action only for the Argentine football star to sit out the entire game in Hong Kong last month will get a 50 per cent refund on tickets by May if they agree to not pursue any further legal complaints, the event’s organiser has announced.
Tatler Asia said on Monday those who bought tickets for the February 4 match between Inter Miami CF and Hong Kong League XI through official channels would receive emails the same day detailing how to claim the refund.
The announcement aims to bring closure for tens of thousands of angered and frustrated Messi fans, some of whom paid as much as HK$4,880 (US$624) per ticket.
Fans who bought their tickets through official platform Klook would have until April 12 to respond to the email and accept the terms and conditions for the refund, Tatler Asia said.
The organiser said refunds would be processed within 30 days after the deadline, adding the actual date for receiving the money could differ depending on the recipient’s bank policies.
Customers who bought tickets through Tatler Asia, as well as the other event sponsors and partners, would be contacted by account managers directly, it said.
