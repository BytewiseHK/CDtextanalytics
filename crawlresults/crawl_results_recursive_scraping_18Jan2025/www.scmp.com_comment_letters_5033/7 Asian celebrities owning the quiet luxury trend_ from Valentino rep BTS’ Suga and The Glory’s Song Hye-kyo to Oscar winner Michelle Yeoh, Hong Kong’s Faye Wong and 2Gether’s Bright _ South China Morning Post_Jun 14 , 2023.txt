Often characterised by timeless silhouettes, premium materials and neutral tones, the “old-money aesthetic” is all about easy-going and discreet elegance with little to no obvious branding – but don’t let the absence of monograms fool you. The fine tailoring and quality materials of “stealth wealth” comes with eye-watering price tags.
This sartorial shift may look simple, but it’s not easy to nail. Here are seven Asian celebrities who have the aesthetic down pat.
While equally chic while off duty, Yeoh prefers a much more toned-down but polished look during her downtime that fits right into the old-money aesthetic.
Descendants of the Sunactress Song Hye-kyo seems to share a similar taste in fashion with her character Moon Dong-eun inThe Glory: expensive yet unassuming. In the hit TV show, Dong-eun’s attire seems modest and low profile at first, but eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that that was far from the truth. As seen in the series, Song’s character casually carries around the exorbitantly expensive Peekaboo ISeeU Mini designer bag by Fendi.
