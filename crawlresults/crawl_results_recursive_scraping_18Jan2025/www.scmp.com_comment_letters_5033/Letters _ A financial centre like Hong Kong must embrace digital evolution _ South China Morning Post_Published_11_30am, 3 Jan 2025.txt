Readers discuss outdated practices across the city’s financial institutions, the basics of promoting snooker, and the West’s ‘my way or the highway’ policy
As someone managing a deceased parent’s estate, I have recently encountered a disturbing pattern of outdated practices across Hong Kong’s financial institutions that threatens our city’s status as a leading financial centre.
This is not merely about convenience. These archaic practices have real consequences: delayed probate applications and thus grants, additional stress during an already difficult time, and unnecessary travel burdens for overseas executors. Each required trip to Hong Kong carries significant personal and financial costs.
With an ageing population and many Hong Kong families spread globally, our financial institutions must modernise their processes or risk undermining Hong Kong’s competitiveness. In an era where cities compete globally to attract financial business and talent, such outdated practices are a liability we cannot afford.
