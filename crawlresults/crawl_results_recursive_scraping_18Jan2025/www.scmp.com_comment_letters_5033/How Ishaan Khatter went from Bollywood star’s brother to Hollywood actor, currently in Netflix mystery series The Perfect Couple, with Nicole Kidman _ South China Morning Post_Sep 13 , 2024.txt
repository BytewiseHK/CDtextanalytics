The son of Indian actors and half-brother to Shahid Kapoor doesn’t want to be seen as a nepo baby, loves dancing, and isn’t ready to make his love life public just yet
So, what else do we know about Ishaan Khatter, who doesn’t want to be lumped together with nepo babies, and finds a “sense of self” in dancing, per The Dirty Magazine?
Recently, in an interview with The Dirty Magazine, Khatter opened up about living with his mum in a compact Mumbai flat that Shahid had bought for them. “It was my mum, me, two other senior people and two cats in there. It had started feeling like a cage to me,” he shared candidly. He now lives alone in a three-bedroom apartment in Mumbai.
Unfortunately for anyone crushing on Khatter, he is taken. In his interview with The Dirty Magazine, theA Suitable Boyactor admitted to having a girlfriend, but drew the line at hard-launching her. Rumour has it though that he may be dating model Chandni Bainz.
Khatter also revealed that his love language is physical touch and agreed when asked if he is a “very sexual” person. “I’m definitely adventurous, and that translates into my sexuality,” he mused, before clarifying, “fortunately – or unfortunately – I’m definitely heterosexual”. He added that believes in monogamy and wants to have a family one day.
For Khatter, coming from a family of creatives meant it was a “natural progression” for him to pursue the arts, he told DNA. “I’ve been most passionate about dancing and acting, so I have followed it obsessively,” he asserted, adding, “I never took this as a safe bet.”
