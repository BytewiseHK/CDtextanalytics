I cannot think of a more fitting description to summarise my life’s work as I have decided to move on from the hustle and bustle of reporting and writing for 33 years. I am leaving the South China Morning Post, a newspaper I have worked at and loved for more than 26 years.
In 2012, I became the Post’s Editor-In-Chief and held the position until the end of 2015, when I relocated to Beijing to be closer to my family and remained as an editorial adviser.
