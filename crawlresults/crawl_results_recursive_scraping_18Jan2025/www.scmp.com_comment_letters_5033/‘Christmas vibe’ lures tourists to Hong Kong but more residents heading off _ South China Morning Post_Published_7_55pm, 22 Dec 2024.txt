13 million passenger trips will be recorded at Hong Kong checkpoints over the Christmas and New Year period, the Immigration Department estimates
Tourists from mainland China and elsewhere are being drawn to Hong Kong by the festive atmosphere although a greater number of residents are heading out of the city for the Christmas break.
Mainland visitor Wang Xin from Shandong province landed at Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday afternoon with her boyfriend for a five-day holiday.
“I have some good memories in the city, so I decided to bring my boyfriend. It’ll be his first time in Hong Kong, and we plan to do all the touristy stuff, including touring around Victoria Harbour and taking the Star Ferry,” said Wang, who is self-employed.
Before boarding a bus to their hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui, she took photos of a dazzling Christmas tree in the middle of the arrival hall. Wang described the airport as “convenient and pretty”.
Some tourists chose Hong Kong because of its strong festive atmosphere.
Eva Nan Xi, a marketing worker in neighbouring Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong by high-speed rail for a day trip to immerse herself in the city’s holiday vibe.
