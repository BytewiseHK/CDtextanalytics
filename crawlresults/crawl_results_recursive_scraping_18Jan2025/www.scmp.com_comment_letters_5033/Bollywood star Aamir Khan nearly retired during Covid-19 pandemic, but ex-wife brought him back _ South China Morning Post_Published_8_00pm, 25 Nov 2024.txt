Khan, famous for “Laal Singh Chaddha,” credits his ex-wife Kiran Rao for his comeback, saying he felt guilty and needed to re-evaluate his priorities
Indian superstar Aamir Khan, one of Bollywood’s highest-grossing actors, said he was on the verge of retirement during the global Covid-19 pandemic until his ex-wife forced him to reconsider.
Khan, 59, is in the United States to promoteLost Ladies, India’s official entry to the foreign language category at the coming Academy Awards, which he has co-produced with ex-wife Kiran Rao.
He said that his family was shocked at his decision to retire.
“I felt that I had not given enough time or bandwidth to my relationships. And that, you know, got me really guilty. And I kind of had a bit of a breakdown,” Khan said in a joint interview with Rao, who also directed the film.
It was Rao’s words that led him to change his mind.
“She said if you’re leaving films, you’re leaving. You’re leaving us, you’re leaving everything. I was a bit taken aback by that. But then I’m glad I changed my mind, and I’m back,” he said.
