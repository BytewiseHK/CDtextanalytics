Multiple-award-winning Hong Kong actor Tony Leung Chiu-wai has been told to make way for younger talent after picking up his latest award at the city’s recent film awards.
Leung, 61, was crowned best actor at the 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards on April 14 for his performance in the filmThe Goldfinger. It is the sixth time he has won the award.
However, fellow Hong Kong film industry luminary, director Wong Jing, said it is time for Leung to step aside in favour of the younger generation.
Wong’s comments, made a day after the awards, have sparked a heated debate on mainland social media.
Wong said on Weibo that he attended the ceremony to show his support for the Hong Kong Film Awards.
After commenting on several other award winners, Wong took aim at Leung’s acting inThe Goldfinger,saying it was not his best performance.
