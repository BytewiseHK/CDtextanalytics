While no longer a manufacturing base for textiles, Hong Kong’s edge in R&D can innovate eco-friendly solutions for the industry
To foster innovation, the Hong Kong government developed initiatives such as the Innovation and Technology Fund and set up the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau. These developments aim to support research and development and promote technological advancements.
These government initiatives are yielding positive results. Hong Kong’s start-up ecosystem has flourished in recent years. The number of start-ups has increased from 3,184 in 2019 to 4,257 in 2023. These start-ups span various sectors including, fintech, biotech and logistics.
These start-ups certainly created jobs and contributed to Hong Kong’s reputation as a hub for innovation and technology. However, the long-term success of these start-ups remains to be seen, as similar competing start-ups can be established elsewhere, such as Singapore, which has similar institutions to support innovation such as its Economic Development Board.
