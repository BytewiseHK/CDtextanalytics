Consumer Council cites organisers as saying they will not be issuing full refunds
“The organiser should explain to each consumer separately. I hope [it] can be more flexible in settling the disputes,” Consumer Council chief executive Gilly Wong Fung-han said on Monday, three days after the event. She cited the organisers as saying they would not be issuing full refunds.
On Sunday night, organisers of the “Legends Assemble” programme said they had set up a WhatsApp hotline for the public and had been in contact with the complainants. But they did not mention at the time whether refunds would be issued.
The dispute arose from a fan meet-and-greet event, co-organised by World Football Legends, Timewow and ACO Media, which took place hours before the exhibition game on Friday between former greats of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona at Hong Kong Stadium.
Fans were charged HK$6,880 for each “Experience Set” ticket, which would allow them to meet players from either of the teams at the Hong Kong Golf and Tennis Academy.
June Lee, president of the Real Madrid Hong Kong Official Fans Club, earlier said 26 members had bought tickets to the event but some of the stars, including Luis Figo, Roberto Carlos and Fabio Cannavaro, had already left the venue by the time the fans arrived.
