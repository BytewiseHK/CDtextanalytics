Do China’s leaders still care what foreigners say about the country? Do they get it that Beijing’s aggressive approach to its changing international environment has lost it friends and stoked disapproval in many parts of the world?
But that is not how people outside the country feel. China’s wolf warrior diplomats respond aggressively to foreign government officials or individuals who challenge Beijing’s narratives on sensitive issues; the state media pushes back strongly against critical reports in the overseas media and labels them as anti-China; the nationalistic online warriors within China go after anyone who tries to present views different from the official line as unpatriotic or appeasing to the West.
Put simply, China gives an impression that it brooks no criticism from anyone, constructive or otherwise.
