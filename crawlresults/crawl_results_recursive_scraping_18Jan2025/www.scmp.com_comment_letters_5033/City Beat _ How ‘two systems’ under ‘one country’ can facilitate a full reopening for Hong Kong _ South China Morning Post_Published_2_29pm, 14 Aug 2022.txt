Ever since late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping decided to open up China in the late 1970s, Hong Kong started playing a significant role in connecting the mainland with the world.
The city now seems to be picking up on its uniqueness, but ironically, the timing could not be worse.
Sceptics still question how such a partial relaxation can help Hong Kong out of its economic downturn, but the city is the envy of counterparts on the mainland, where easing quarantine is unthinkable if infections are on the rise. Hong Kong has been recording an average of more than 4,000 cases daily for more than three weeks, with no sign of improvement.
Practically speaking, when most of the world is “living with the virus”, Hong Kong can be seen as a pilot study for Beijing to fine-tune its many restrictions for the rest of the country.
