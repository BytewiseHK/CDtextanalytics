A US report on worker exploitation adds urgency to the call for reform of an industry already battling accusations of environmental abuse
The report highlighted the poor working conditions prevalent in nickel smelters, primarily located on the islands of Sulawesi and Maluku, where workers face harsh treatment including arbitrary wage deductions, violence and constant surveillance.
