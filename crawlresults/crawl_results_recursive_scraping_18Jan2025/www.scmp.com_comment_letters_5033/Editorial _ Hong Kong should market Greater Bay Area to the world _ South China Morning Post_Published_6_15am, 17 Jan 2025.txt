As the region’s superconnector, city is best placed to explain the incredible opportunities available in the development zone
The national drive to turn 11 southern cities into an economic powerhouse was little more than a concept when it was first rolled out in early 2019. Today, the development of the Greater Bay Area has become a reality, with cross-border integration and collaboration advancing in a way that seemed unimaginable just a few years ago.
While the blueprint has opened new horizons for Hong Kong and other cities under the development strategy, there remain gaps to fill and challenges to overcome in order to maximise the opportunities.
This was reflected in the Post’s annual China Conference: Greater Bay Area 2025 held in Nansha on Wednesday, the first such forum by a Hong Kong media company in one of the mainland cities under the central government’s development drive. The two-day event comprised conferences attended by 300 attendees, mostly from overseas, followed by site visits to businesses in the area.
Among the attendees were consuls general and deputy consuls from eight countries – Australia, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey.
Former chief executive Leung Chun-ying stressed the need for Hong Kong to better play its role as a “superconnector” under the “one country, two systems” principle to connect the bay area with the outside world. Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun pledged to use the river loop area near the border with the mainland for cooperation with neighbouring cities and continue to provide better financial services for the bay area.
