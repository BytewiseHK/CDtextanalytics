I have adopted a new ritual since the pandemic began two years ago. I try to start every day with a swim. Swimming keeps me sane and has given my life structure during these uncertain times.
As the virus morphs and creates curveballs, I never know when I am going to have to return to the office or keep teleworking. The boundaries between work and play, weekdays and weekends have faded.
Simultaneously, the pandemic has added new layers of stress to our work lives, such as the pressure to pick up new forms of technology. Many of us “working stiffs” say we wish we could win simply the lottery and retire.
Anecdotally, it seemed to me recently that many people I knew were newly or soon-to-be retired. The numbers confirm the stories; the retired population has grown globally, in large part due to the pandemic.
With the rapid changes occurring in the world of work and the ever-growing list of skills needed to keep up, many older people found themselves being forced to retire early. In the US alone, the number of retired workers receiving Social Security benefits was nearly 70 million in 2021, a leap from 45.1 million in 2019.
Amid these changes, an unspoken chasm between the retired and the working began to develop in my psyche. My “congratulations” felt lukewarm to a friend who announced her retirement and went to Disney World not once but twice.
