Fujian will also roll out policies to support Taiwanese people who seek education and work in the province, Communist Party official says
While some provinces have their own Taiwan affairs offices, it is unusual to have these offices at the county level.
Writing in the state-run magazine China Institutional Organisation last week, Zhou said the move was part of an institutional reform to strengthen the cross-strait affairs system.
“Going forward, [we] will take institutional reforms into consideration to guide municipalities and counties to effectively improve the development of Taiwan affairs offices and reinforce their respective responsibilities,” he said.
Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force, if necessary. The United States, like most countries, does not recognise the self-governed island as an independent state but it is opposed to any attempt to take it by force and is legally bound to arm it for defence.
