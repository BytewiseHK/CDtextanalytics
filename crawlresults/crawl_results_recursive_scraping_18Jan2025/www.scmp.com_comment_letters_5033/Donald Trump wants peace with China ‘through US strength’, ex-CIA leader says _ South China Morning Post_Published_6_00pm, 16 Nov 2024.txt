The ‘anti-war’ president-elect’s main goal is to make it clear that Beijing ‘shouldn’t even think about fighting’, ex-intelligence chief says
Donald Trump will be hawkish towards China but does not want a war, according to a former deputy assistant director of the CIA.
Dennis Wilder said on the sidelines of a forum in Hong Kong on Friday, that the president-elect’s philosophy was “peace through strength” and his “goal is to make it clear to Beijing that it shouldn’t even think about fighting”.
“Trump is anti-war and unlikely to engage in conflict during his term,” Wilder, who is now a senior fellow at Georgetown University, said.
Wilder added: “The defence budget will likely increase by five per cent, with more missile units, ships, and air capabilities,” he said.
He said Trump believes strength prevents challenges and sees Joe Biden’s “weakness” as the reason for Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Beijing’s confidence against the United States.
Wilder said he expected talks between the two countries’ militaries would continue and pointed to a recent meeting in Qingdao as evidence that the defence dialogue would probably survive under the new Trump’s administration.
