Education Bureau calls on schools that persist with practice to avoid placing pressure on children and instead focus on mental health
The Education Bureau also praised some schools for implementing continuous assessment, rather than exams, and arranging “no homework days” to reduce academic pressure on students.
“There are still a small number of schools that use written assessments for tests and examinations in the first semester of Primary One, or require students in senior grades in both primary schools and secondary schools to regularly make up classes outside school days. This situation requires attention,” the bureau said in its annual inspection report published on Monday.
The bureau called on those institutions to review their school-based assessments, assignment policies and supplementary lesson arrangements as soon as possible.
“[This is] to avoid causing unnecessary learning pressure on students, and [schools have to] systematically plan and implement measures to promote students’ physical and mental health to achieve students’ holistic development,” it said.
Authorities reviewed 235 primary, secondary and special schools in the 2023-24 academic year in the report.
