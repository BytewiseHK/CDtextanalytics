Readers discuss the city’s ambition to be a regulatory hub for institutional digital assets, the difficult road to Mandarin competency, and supermarket shrinkflation
The city’s drive to become a cross-border financial hub for blockchain and tokenised assets is a balancing act: approaching institutional innovation with caution while not falling behind by being overly cautious.
After a few weeks in Hong Kong, my perspective is shifting. The city and its financial institutions are playing a longer game than many realise. Rather than pushing for retail crypto trading, Hong Kong is laying the groundwork for the more ambitious goal of becoming a regulatory hub for institutional digital assets, particularly in international trade – an important bet as the financial sector constitutes nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product.
