Both sides have been sending positive signals but they must find a way for non-hawkish heads to prevail in a crisis
The countdown to the inauguration of the next US president has begun in earnest and both Beijing and Donald Trump are sending positive signals.
For example, Trump sidestepped a media question on whether the United States would intervene in a military conflict over Taiwan. It was a stark contrast to outgoing US President Joe Biden who has said openly that the US would step in if Beijing used force against the island.
He also said he was optimistic that both sides could manage risks in the Taiwan Strait over the next four years.
