At first, I thought it was imagined or something temporary after Covid-19 was first recognised in the US. Chinese restaurants and Chinatowns across the country were affected, with some eateries permanently closed because of the loss of business. It didn’t help that then-US president Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as “the China virus”.
My father, in his early 70s, migrated to Canada and then the US to pursue his studies in his youth. He had some advice for my sister and me. “Keep your head down and a low profile,” he said, urging us to stay at home to avoid the deadly pandemic and the ugly and invisible reality of discrimination and hatred that was brewing.
At the time, it seemed over-the-top – until I had a few experiences that caused me to question how Asian Americans are regarded in our home country during these unprecedented times.
