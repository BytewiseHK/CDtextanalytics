In National Day speech, Chinese leader says the island is the country’s ‘ sacred territory’
Taiwan was “China’s sacred territory” and “the people on both sides of the [Taiwan] Strait are connected by blood”, Xi said at an official event in Beijing to mark Tuesday’s 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.
“We must … promote the spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities,” he said.

China’s Xi Jinping warns ‘Taiwan separatists’, stresses support for Hong Kong and Macau
Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force, if necessary. Most countries, including the United States, do not recognise self-governed Taiwan as independent, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the island by force and is committed to arming it for defence.
Xi also pledged “staunch backing” for Hong Kong and Macau to preserve and promote the prosperity and stability of the two special administrative regions.
