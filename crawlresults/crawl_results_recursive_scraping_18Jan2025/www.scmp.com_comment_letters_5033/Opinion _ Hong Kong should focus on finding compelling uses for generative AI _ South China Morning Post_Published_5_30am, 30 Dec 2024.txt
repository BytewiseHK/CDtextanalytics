Foundational tech is important but what people need and want will dictate the success or failure of generative AI and the return on investment
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has charmed the world. Its ability to digest and produce content such as text, images and videos presents opportunities for any industry that needs to communicate – from medicine, law and finance to the creative arts, architecture and biochemical sciences.
