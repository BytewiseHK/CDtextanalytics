US president-elect also warned of potential Chinese influence on the passage, saying the canal should not be managed by China
US president-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert US control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino.
China does not control or administer the canal. However, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings manages two ports located on the Caribbean and Pacific entrances to the canal, respectively.
The post was a very rare example of a US leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in US diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.
“It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,” he wrote.
The Panamanian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
