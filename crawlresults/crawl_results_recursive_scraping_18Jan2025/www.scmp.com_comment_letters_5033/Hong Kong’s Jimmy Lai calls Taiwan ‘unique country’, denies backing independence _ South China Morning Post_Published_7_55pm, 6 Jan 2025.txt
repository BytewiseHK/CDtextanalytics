Former media tycoon has returned to the witness box following two-week break during holidays
Hong Kong’s Apple Daily tabloid founder Jimmy Lai Chee-ying has denied advocating for Taiwan’s independence with his predictions the self-ruling island will become a “quasi-sovereign state” and “unique country” amid strengthening ties with Washington.
The former media boss also maintained on Monday the United States was trying to prevent war with Beijing by strengthening its military presence in Taiwan, while denying he ever suggested an all-out conflict between the two countries.
The 77-year-old is contesting two conspiracy charges of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications.
