Indulge in Michelin-starred Christmas fare at Petrus, drink classic cocktails at Darkside, enjoy the harbourside AIA Carnival, and check out MGM Macau’s new show
There’s no festive meal more sumptuous than that at one-Michelin-starred Petrus, and for this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, chef Uwe Opocensky has designed a four-course lunch and eight-course dinner, with highlights such as Antilope 1858 oyster, Spanish red prawn and beef calotte. The climax of the meal, however, comes at the very end, when Opocensky assembles an entire gingerbread village at each table with a generous dusting of Christmas magic.

Ranked 17th on Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2024, Darkside has launched a new cocktail collection inspired by the 1920s and 30s, where each cocktail pays tribute to classic recipes embodying the glamour of the Roaring Twenties. The real highlights include lesser-known but no less worthy concoctions such as the Blood and Sand or the Brown Derby, both updated with subtle touches for the modern palate.
