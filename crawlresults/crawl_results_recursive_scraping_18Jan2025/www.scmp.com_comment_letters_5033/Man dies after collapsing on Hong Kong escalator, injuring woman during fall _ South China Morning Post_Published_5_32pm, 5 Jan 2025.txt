Man with history of medical problems collapses in Sha Tin and falls onto woman behind him, with pair rushed to hospital
A 36-year-old man has died after he collapsed on an escalator outside a Hong Kong wet market, injuring a woman as he fell backwards.
Police said they received a report from the manâ€™s mother, who was accompanying him as he took an escalator connecting Sha Kok Market and Sha Kok Commercial Centre in Sha Tin before he fainted and fell on Sunday.
The man, who was described as having a history of medical problems, hit a 65-year-old woman as he collapsed, causing them both to fall to the ground.
Paramedics took the man, who was unconscious, and the elderly woman, to Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin for treatment, where he was later pronounced dead.
A source said the man suffered from hypertension and diabetes.
The woman sustained a head injury that required hospitalisation, police said.
