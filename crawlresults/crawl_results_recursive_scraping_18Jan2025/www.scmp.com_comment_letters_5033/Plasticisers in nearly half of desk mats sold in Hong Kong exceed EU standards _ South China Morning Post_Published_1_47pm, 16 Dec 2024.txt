Seven out of 15 products tested by Consumer Council contain ‘reproductive toxicants’ at levels that could harm users’ endocrine system
The level of plasticisers used in nearly half of 15 desk mats tested by Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog has been found to exceed EU standards, with one model registering 222 times the limit.
The Consumer Council on Monday also warned that desk mats should not be used as placemats for dining and children should clean their hands after touching the items.
The council tested 15 desk mats, which are commonly used to protect desktops from cutting, drawing and writing, and found that the levels of four types of phthalate plasticisers in seven models exceeded the limit set by the EU.
Those four types of plasticisers were classified as “reproductive toxicants” and found to “impair fertility or fetal health and interfere with the endocrine system,” the council said.
The level of reproductive toxicants in one tested writing mat was 222 times that of the EU standard, while three other types of plasticisers allowed under European Union standards could also harm young children’s livers, it added.
Council CEO Gilly Wong Fung-han warned that consumers should avoid using desk mats as placemats for dining.
“Instead of buying one for multiple purposes, this test exercise would advise … to separate the usage of mats [for different uses],” Wong said.
