The Post visits island in Zhuhai to learn how new settlers are coping as Macau marks 25th anniversary of return to Chinese administration
When Macau residents Amy Leong and Danniel Ng embarked on a plan to relocate for retirement, they hit an unexpected hurdle: finding affordable moving services proved challenging because of the extra charges for customs clearance.
They had decided to move from the city, where they had lived for decades, to Hengqin, an island in neighbouring Zhuhai that is jointly managed by the Guangdong and Macau governments.
A residential project exclusively for city residents, the Macau New Neighbourhood, was rolled out last year.
The couple in their sixties bought a three-bedroom flat for about 3 million yuan (US$411,180), which they said was more expensive than other homes in Zhuhai, but still cheaper than in Macau.
“Hiring a mover is even more expensive than buying all [the furniture] over again from the mainland,” Leong said.
The couple decided to move their belongings using their own car, making multiple trips between Macau and Hengqin.
