Authorities say some lanes of Lin Cheung Road had to be closed to traffic due to accident
A Hong Kong driver has died after his truck collided with a waste collection vehicle, forcing authorities to close off lanes of a West Kowloon road.
A police spokesman said on Monday afternoon that the light goods truck slammed into the back of the other vehicle that might have broken down on Lin Cheung Road going toward the Western Harbour Tunnel.
Firefighters freed the driver from the truck and he was taken to Kwong Wah Hospital with multiple serious injuries, before he was certified dead at 8.17am.
Dashcam footage circulating online shows the medium-sized truck hitting the back of the waste collection vehicle, with the front of the former crushed due to the collision. Some parts of the truck were seen scattered on the road.
In a notice issued at 9.11am, the Transport Department said some lanes of Lin Cheung Road bound for the Western Harbour Tunnel near Tonkin Street West had to be closed off, causing traffic congestion.
An investigation into the crash is under way.
