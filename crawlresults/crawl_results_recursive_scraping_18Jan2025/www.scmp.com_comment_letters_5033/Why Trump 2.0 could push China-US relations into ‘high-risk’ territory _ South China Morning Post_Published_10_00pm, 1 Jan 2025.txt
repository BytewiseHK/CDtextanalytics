Foreign policy expert says that structural contradiction between US and China may undermine the current stability in relations
In a commentary last week, Shen spoke highly of the US-China detente following an eventful year, especially amid concerns among China watchers that Washington might cause China-US relations to deteriorate during the election year.
“However, the contradiction between China and the United States is structural, while the stability currently restored to the relationship is not,” she wrote in the biweekly journal World Affairs, which is published by a press controlled by the Chinese foreign ministry.
“As the US locks in its strategy of great power competition, China-US ties still face enormous challenges.”
She credited outgoing US President Joe Biden’s administration for adjusting its tactics from “intense competition” to “managing competition”, which helped stabilise ties by reopening “more than 20 communication mechanisms”.
