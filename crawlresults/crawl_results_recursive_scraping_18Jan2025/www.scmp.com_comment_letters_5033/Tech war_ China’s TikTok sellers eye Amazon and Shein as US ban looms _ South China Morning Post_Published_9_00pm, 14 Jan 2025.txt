Cross-border merchants in China are bracing for an impending ban on TikTok in the US
Qian Liu, a seller who runs 12 stores on TikTok targeting US consumers, has been marking down inventories and delaying the purchase of new stock, as she awaits the US Supreme Court’s final ruling on the app’s future.
Profits from her US business had been so impressive that she had planned to rent an office and hire local staff there, said Qian, who is based in Zhuhai city in southern Guangdong province. “But I haven’t done that yet because I feel that TikTok’s operations in the US aren’t stable,” she said.
