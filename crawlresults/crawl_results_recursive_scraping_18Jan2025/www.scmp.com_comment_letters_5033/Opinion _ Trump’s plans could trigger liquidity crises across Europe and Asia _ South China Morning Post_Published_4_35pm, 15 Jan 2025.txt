Inflationary pressure and a growing deficit would turn the US into a liquidity-sucking force
Donald Trump’s policies as US president, set against China’s manufacturing competitiveness, could trigger a liquidity crisis for many countries squeezed in between.
The euro is at greatest risk but the Japanese yen and Indian rupee are also in the firing line. A US debt crisis is further down the road when there are no significant economies left to bleed.
Two years after the Covid-19 pandemic, US companies and government agencies are still having a hard time getting staff to return to work in the office. There is very little chance of productivity bringing down inflation.
Two of Trump’s three major policy thrusts – more import tariffs and mass deportations – are clearly inflationary. Even if the tariffs end up boosting domestic production, it would take a long time. Further, there is no evidence from Trump’s first trade war to support the possibility of a supply response within the United States.
