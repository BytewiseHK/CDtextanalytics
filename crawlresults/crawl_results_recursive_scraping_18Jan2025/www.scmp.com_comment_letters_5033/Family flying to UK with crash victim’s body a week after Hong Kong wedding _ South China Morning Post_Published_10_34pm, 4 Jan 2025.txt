Mourners attend prayer ceremony for Mohammad Nadeem Adalat, one of three men killed in New Year’s Day’s car crash
The family of one of three men killed in a car crash on New Year’s Day will fly back to Britain with his body, a week after they celebrated his wedding in Hong Kong.
A funeral prayer was held on Saturday for Mohammad Nadeem Adalat who was killed just three days after his wedding.
Some of the 33-year-old’s childhood friends and schoolmates were present at the Masjid Ammar and Osman Ramju Sadick Islamic Centre in Wan Chai, along with many local Muslims who did not know him personally.
The ceremony was held one day after the funeral of Ihtsham Ali, 30, and Mohammad Faisal, 34, who were killed in the same accident on the West Kowloon Highway early on Wednesday.
Adalat’s body, wrapped in a green cloth, arrived at the mosque around 1.35pm after Zuhr, one of the daily Islamic prayer times. His family planned to take the body to the airport and return to the United Kingdom, where they had emigrated from Hong Kong more than 15 years ago.
Alex Mohammad Ilyas, a former president of the Pakistan Association of Hong Kong, said Adalat had rented a flat in Tsuen Wan earlier and was considering moving back and working in the city after getting married.
