Public buses subject of more than 4,000 complaints in second quarter of 2024, increasing by 24.6 per cent year on year
Buses faced the most complaints among the cityâ€™s public transport services in the second quarter of 2024, increasing by 24.6 per cent year on year to more 4,000, with a lawmaker attributing the trend to labour shortages.
The Transport Advisory Committee revealed on Monday that its Transport Complaints Unit had received 12,788 complaints and suggestions from April to June of this year, the highest since 2020.
Most of the feedback focused on public transport services, particularly franchised buses.
Figures from the committee showed only 211 of the submissions were purely suggestions.
More than 44 per cent of the feedback, or 5,646 items, named bus services operated by firms such as KMB, Citybus, Long Win Bus and New Lantao Bus.
The most common topics were the standards and adequacy of the services.
