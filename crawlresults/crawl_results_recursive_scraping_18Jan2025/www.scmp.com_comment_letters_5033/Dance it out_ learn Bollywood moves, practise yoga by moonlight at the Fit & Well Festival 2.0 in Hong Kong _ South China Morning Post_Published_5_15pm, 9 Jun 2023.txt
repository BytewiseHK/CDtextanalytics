Hitesh Amarnani has some advice for those thinking about learning Bollywood dance, the dynamic and theatrical style seen in Indian films: just be yourself.
“As long as you love music, as long as you love to move, it’s going to be great,” says Amarnani, who has been busting Bollywood moves for almost 30 years, starting at his home in India and sharing his skills from Bangkok to Hong Kong, where he founded the World Dance Company in 2017. “Don’t be shy or worry about whether you’re doing it right, just enjoy it.”
Amarnani will share his Bollywood dance moves on June 16 at the dance party sessions of the annual “Fit & Well Festival 2.0”. On the same night, Dee Oh will turn up the pop tunes to host a high-energy cardio dance.
Part two of the festival will be held on July 7. This time it is a more chilled affair, with Priscilla Ho, Charlotte Chiu and Janet Fong guiding moonlight yoga sessions.
Both events will be held at the Central Harbourfront Event Space on Hong Kong Island from 7pm to 10pm.
“The idea behind the festival is to promote an active and healthy lifestyle, to motivate people,” says Kitty Lo, founder of health and wellness consulting firm Qintensity Fitness, which is hosting the festival in partnership with Central Venue Management.
