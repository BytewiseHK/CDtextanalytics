Number of students applying for aided and government primary schools through the allocation system also hits 15-year low
Almost half of Hong Kong pupils have secured a Primary One spot at their preferred school for the next academic year, down by about 0.5 percentage points from last year, amid a shrinking student population.
The Education Bureau said on Friday that 41,781 children were applying for discretionary places in government and aided primary schools, with results to be available to parents on Monday.
Among the children, 20,644 were offered a place in these schools, or 49.41 per cent of all applicants.
This figure was 0.47 percentage points lower than the 49.88 per cent level last year.
Each applicant is only allowed to apply for one aided or government school in this stage.
Among the discretionary places offered, 10,644 were given to children whose siblings are studying in or whose parents are working at the applied schools, which must admit those applicants.
