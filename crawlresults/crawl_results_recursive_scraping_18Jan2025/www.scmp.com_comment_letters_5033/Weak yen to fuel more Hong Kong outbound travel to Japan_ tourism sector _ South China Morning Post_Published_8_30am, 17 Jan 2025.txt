But retail insiders say they are hopeful resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents will mitigate local spending decline
More Hongkongers are expected to travel to Japan amid a weak yen, tourism industry representatives have said after the country welcomed a record number of foreign tourists last year.
Retail sector representatives also said on Thursday that the strong momentum of outbound travel by Hongkongers had hurt local consumption, but the impact would be mitigated by the anticipated rise in mainland Chinese tourists following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
Steve Huen Kwok-chuen, executive director of travel agency EGL Tours, attributed the increased number of Hongkongers travelling to Japan to the weak yen, which made shopping and dining more cost-effective.
He also pointed to the growing capacity of airlines flying between Hong Kong and the country.
“I believe Japan will remain a top tourist destination among Hongkongers this year,” he said, adding that many customers had already signed up for his company’s cherry blossom-themed tours to Japan in March and April.
Statistics released by the Japan National Tourism Organisation on Wednesday showed that about 36.9 million foreign visitors travelled to the country in 2024.
