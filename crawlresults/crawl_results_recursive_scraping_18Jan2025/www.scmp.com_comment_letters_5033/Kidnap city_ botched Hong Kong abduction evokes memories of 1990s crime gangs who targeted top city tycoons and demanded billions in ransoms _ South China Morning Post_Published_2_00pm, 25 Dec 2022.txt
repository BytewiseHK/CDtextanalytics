A viral video of a woman in Hong Kong being forced into a van in broad daylight earlier this month sent shockwaves through the city.
What turned out to be a botched kidnap attempt took place as she waited at a bus stop outside a maximum security prison.
The woman was rescued later the same day. Four local suspects, including a 16-year-old girl and three men, aged 17 to 37, have been detained by police.
However, shock at the public nature of the attempted abduction stems from the fact that Hong Kong is generally considered to be one of the safest cities in the world when it comes to such crimes.
Just six kidnappings were reported between January 2011 and November last year.
