New, highly dangerous drug must be outlawed as soon as possible, while education on its deadly effects should be stepped up
A deadly narcotic menace newly emerging in Hong Kong must be taken seriously. It is good that authorities are speeding up efforts to add the substance known as “space oil” to the city’s Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
However, the public should also be on alert to counter a sharp rise in abuse, particularly among younger people.
Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung earlier this month said users were being misled into thinking space oil was harmless, but the drug, which contains the anaesthetic etomidate, is believed to have played a role in at least three deaths this year.
The legislative process to get the drug listed is now expected to be done by the first quarter of next year or even as early as February. Tang told a Legislative Council panel the government’s original plan was to get the job done in the second quarter of 2025.
The urgency is wise given the nature of the threat. Space oil is commonly enclosed in e-cigarette capsules. The anaesthetic requires a doctor’s prescription – etomidate is classified as a Part 1 poison and can be mixed with other drugs such as cannabis, methamphetamine and ketamine.
Serious physical and mental harm is possible. Addiction, memory loss, seizure, loss of consciousness and even death are possible, according to the government’s Action Committee Against Narcotics.
