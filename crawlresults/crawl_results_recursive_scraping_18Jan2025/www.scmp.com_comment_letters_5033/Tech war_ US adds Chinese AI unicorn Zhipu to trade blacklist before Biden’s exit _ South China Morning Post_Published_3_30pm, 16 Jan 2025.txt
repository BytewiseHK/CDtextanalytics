Zhipu AI is among more than two dozen China and Singapore-based companies added to the US Entity List on Wednesday
Beijing-based Zhipu said late on Wednesday that the US move “lacks a factual basis”. It added that the firm’s inclusion on the Entity List “will not have a substantial impact” on its operations.
Sophgo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Post was unable to contact PowerAIR, which does not have any official website, publicly listed phone number or email address.
