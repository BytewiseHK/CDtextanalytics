2,000 intellectual groups now advise Beijing, but experts say they are producing fewer ‘constructive comments’ to influence decision makers
But as Beijing seeks urgent economic reforms against the backdrop of a growing geopolitical rivalry between the two countries, several prominent Chinese scholars have said China’s think tanks need to do more.
Despite the rapid expansion and increasing global influence of China’s thought groups, the scholars have cautioned that they still fall short in terms of professionalism and academic achievements – deficiencies that could curb their influence in both domestic and international arenas.
Some experts have also urged the bodies to defend their independence while calling for more privately funded think tanks to diversify in public sectors, despite China’s shrinking space for discourse.
Zheng Yongnian, a scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, who is also a Beijing policy adviser, told a panel last month that despite significant improvement over the past decade, China’s think tanks still lacked “originality” and had produced fewer “constructive comments” in recent years.
