Police commissioner urges public to consider their safety more carefully before heading out on hiking trips
Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu Chak-yee said on Sunday the number of calls for help from countryside areas increased from 161 in 2023 to 202 last year. Tourists were involved in 56 cases in 2024, which was nearly twice the 29 cases the year before.
Siu urged the public to consider their safety more carefully before heading out on hiking trips.
He said most calls were related to accidents caused by people overestimating their personal abilities, going hiking alone or in dangerous weather, getting distracted while taking photos in treacherous areas and being underprepared with emergency supplies.
“According to our experience, we spend a lot of time searching for hikers in distress, as phone signals in such areas are unstable and it becomes difficult for them to call for help,” Siu said.
“If it takes too long, their lives could seriously be at risk.”
