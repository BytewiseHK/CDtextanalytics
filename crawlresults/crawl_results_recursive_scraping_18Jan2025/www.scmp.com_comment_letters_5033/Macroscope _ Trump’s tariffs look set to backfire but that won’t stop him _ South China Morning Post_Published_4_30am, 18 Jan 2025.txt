While it’s hard to predict the outcome of US president-elect’s nationalist economic strategy, all signs point to self-inflicted damage
It seems so. Moreover, if Trump’s use of the tariffs as a weapon turns out to be as aggressive as he has threatened, it would represent a classic case of shooting himself and the US in the foot while wounding many others in the process.
These are my chief takeaways after moderating a recent panel discussion at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan on the potential economic impact on Asia of Trump’s second term. What came across was the sheer complexity of tariff-related issues in contrast with Trump’s simplistic approach to dealing with them.
This raises questions about the quality of political leadership in leading nations, especially – although not exclusively – in the United States. Populism has allowed people who are economic ignoramuses to be elevated to the heights of political power.
