Users could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app
To pull it off, the law targets a wide swathe of US-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone’s country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.
At best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.
Here’s a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.
The law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.
