Former Hong Kong chief executives still have a role to play, but there is also a need to spend wisely during difficult financial times
Having stepped down, Hong Kong’s four former chief executives would naturally receive less media exposure and public attention.
But the fact that there is a regular budget for the operation of their offices means the need for accountability and transparency remains unchanged.
This is especially true when the government is expected to spend even more wisely in times of a ballooning budget deficit.
The latest decision to relocate the office of Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor from a prime commercial tower to a government building is a positive step to address concerns over soaring costs.
The current 2,874 sq ft workspace at One Pacific Place in Admiralty costs an estimated HK$9.17 million (US$1.17 million) in the 2023-24 financial year, after rent and related expenses climbed from an annual HK$4.43 million to HK$5.67 million. The cost-saving move has been welcomed by Lam.
The expenditure on Lam’s office has understandably attracted closer scrutiny because it accounted for 44 per cent of the spending on all four offices of the ex-leaders.
