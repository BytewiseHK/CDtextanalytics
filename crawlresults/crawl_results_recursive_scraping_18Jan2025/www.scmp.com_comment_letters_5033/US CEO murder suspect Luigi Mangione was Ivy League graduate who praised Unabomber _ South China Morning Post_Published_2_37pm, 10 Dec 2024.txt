Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested by police in Pennsylvania on Monday for the murder of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York
Valedictorian at his US$37,000-a-year all-boys prep school. Founder of a gaming club and graduate at an Ivy League university. A rapidly ascending data engineer at TrueCar Inc.
Luigi Nicholas Mangione was all that. And now, he’s been charged in New York with the murder of insurance executive Brian Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two gunned down last week in Midtown Manhattan.
To some, Mangione – if he is indeed the killer – represents a folk hero acting on the collective rage of a nation against the perceived faults of the insurance industry. Others see him as the face of a country where law and order has broken down, morality has collapsed and company executives are scapegoated with deadly consequences for systemic inequities.
He was found with a home-made gun and a manifesto, which a person familiar with the matter described as anti-capitalist and critical of health-care companies’ profit motives. It said he acted alone and was self-funded, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters and declined to elaborate.
