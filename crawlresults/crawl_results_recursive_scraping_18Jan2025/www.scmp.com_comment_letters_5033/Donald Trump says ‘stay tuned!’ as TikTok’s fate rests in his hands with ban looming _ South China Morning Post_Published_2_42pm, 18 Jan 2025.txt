President-elect promises decision ‘in the not too distant future’ after Supreme Court upholds sell-or-ban law for Chinese-owned video app
In a video posted on the social media platform in response to the court’s ruling, TikTok chief executive Chew Shou Zi vowed that the company would “do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives”.
He also thanked the president-elect “for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States”.
“TikTok is a place where people can create communities, discover new interests and express themselves, including over 7 million American businesses who earn a living and gain new customers using our platform,” he said.
Trump called for the court’s decision to be respected, writing on social media: “My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!”
Chew met Trump last month and has been invited to his inauguration on Monday. Other attendees will include Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng, the most senior Beijing official to attend a US presidential inauguration.
