Product by South Korean brand Missha has no ascorbic acid, while many others also over-reported quantities of antioxidant ingredient
One of 17 vitamin C skincare products tested by Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog has been found not to contain the antioxidant ingredient at all, while most of the remaining samples have lower levels than their labels indicate.
The Consumer Council on Tuesday called on cosmetics manufacturers to enhance their quality control and product labelling, including of ascorbic acid, the chemical name for vitamin C.
“Vitamin C is most commonly known for its antioxidant properties. Normal skin would contain a certain concentration of vitamin C to promote the production of collagen, hence many skincare products in recent years use vitamin C as a selling point,” it said.
“The test results did not find any vitamin C traces in one out of the 17 samples.”
The sample with no vitamin C was Vita C Ascorbic Acid Spot Correction and Firming Essence by South Korean cosmetic brand Missha, sold at HK$185 (US$24) for a 30ml bottle.
Missha had not responded to the council’s inquiry, the watchdog said.
