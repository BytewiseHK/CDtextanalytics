While multiple factors drive market booms, the advances in real estate transparency in Asia are significant and should not be downplayed
What a difference four years makes. Every other year, JLL and LaSalle publish the findings of their Global Real Estate Transparency Index, a benchmark of market transparency in 89 countries and territories that assesses the legal and regulatory environment, availability of data and operating conditions across a wide range of geographies.
There is a strong link between levels of transparency and investment activity. JLL notes that the 13-strong highly transparent group – which also includes the United States, Britain, and Germany – accounts for more than 50 per cent of income-producing real estate and more than 80 per cent of direct investment worldwide.
Although Asian markets, with the exception of Japan, are less mature and liquid, the region as a whole still constituted 26.8 per cent of the professionally managed global real estate investment market last year.
