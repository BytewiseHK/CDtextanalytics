‘Savvy’ Hong Kong shoppers have plenty of options in run-up to holiday as operators roll out free coaches and malls splash out on promotions
Stores are not the only ones trying to grab the attention of shoppers amid a weakened economic environment on both sides of the border. Tour agencies are also hunting for dollars, combining leisure travel with shopping.
Some retailers are going to great lengths.
Shanghai-based Freshippo, a grocery chain operated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, is providing free shuttle buses for Hongkongers to reach its Shenzhen branches for Lunar New Year shopping on January 11, 12, 18 and 19.
One of the services will take shoppers directly from Sheung Shui to its Nanshan store.
The first day of Lunar New Year is January 29.
