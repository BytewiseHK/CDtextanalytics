Biden, 81, gave his support for Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him.
His decision makes him the first elected American president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 to opt not to seek a second term.
“I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down,” he said in his early afternoon message, adding a few minutes later: “I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”
Biden said he would speak to the nation later in the week in more detail about his decision. The political earthquake comes less than a month before the Democratic party convention.
“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice-President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made,” Biden added. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.
