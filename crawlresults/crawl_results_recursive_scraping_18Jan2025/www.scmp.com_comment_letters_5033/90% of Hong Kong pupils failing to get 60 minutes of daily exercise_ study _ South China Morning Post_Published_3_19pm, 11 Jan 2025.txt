Academic says a major reason for children not getting enough exercise is the heavy emphasis parents place on academic results
More than 90 per cent of Hong Kong school pupils are failing to get at least 60 minutes of exercise a day as recommended by the World Health Organization, a citywide study has found.
The results of the university study, which collected data on the physical activities of 1,476 primary school pupils and 1,929 secondary students, were released on Saturday.
“Overall, the exercise level of children in Hong Kong is very insufficient,” said Patrick Ip Pak-keung, a clinical professor at the University of Hong Kong’s paediatrics and adolescent medicine department.
The study, conducted by Ip’s department, gathered data using special monitoring bracelets that students wore for several weeks during the 2023-24 school year.
Researchers found that only 7.4 per cent of study participants managed to do a minimum of 60 minutes of medium- to vigorous-intensity physical activity every day, the WHO’s benchmark for those aged five to 17.
The figure stood at 7.9 per cent in the previous school year.
