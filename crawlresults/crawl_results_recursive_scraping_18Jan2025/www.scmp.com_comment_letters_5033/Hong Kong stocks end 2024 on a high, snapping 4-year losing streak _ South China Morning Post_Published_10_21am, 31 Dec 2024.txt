Hang Seng Index rises 18 per cent this year, while on the mainland the CSI 300 Index gains 15 per cent
The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.1 per cent to 20,059.95 in a shortened trading session on Tuesday, while the Hang Seng Tech Index retreated 0.7 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index and the Shanghai Composite Index both shed 1.6 per cent. The markets will be closed on Wednesday for New Year’s Day.
For the year, the benchmark index gained 18 per cent, snapping a record streak of four consecutive annual losses after China unveiled a rescue package to spur growth, including new funding facilities for stock purchases and the lifting of home-buying restrictions.
Investors are keeping a close watch on the implementation of stimulus measures after top officials pledged more aggressive policy easing for next year. The CSI 300 Index gained 15 per cent in 2024.
“China’s economy is on a weak recovery and the momentum is pretty weak,” said Shen Fanchao, an analyst at Zheshang International. “There’s big pressure on downward revision of earnings forecasts. But on the policy front, more supportive policies will come in 2025. At this stage, we advise investors exercise caution about the market in the near term.”
