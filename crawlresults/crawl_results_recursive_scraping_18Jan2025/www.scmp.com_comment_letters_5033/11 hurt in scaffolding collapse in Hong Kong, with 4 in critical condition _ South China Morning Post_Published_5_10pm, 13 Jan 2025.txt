Structure measuring 60 metres by 20 metres partially gave way at about 4pm at construction site for new hospital in Kai Tak
A scaffolding collapse at a construction site for a new hospital in Hong Kong’s Kai Tak has left 11 workers injured, including four critically.
The bamboo structure, measuring 60 metres by 20 metres (197 feet by 66 feet), gave way at about 4pm on Monday.
Two workers had been trapped at the site on Shing Cheong Road, where the acute hospital is being built. The facility is expected to be one of the city’s largest hospitals upon completion.
A female worker, one of the four listed as critically hurt, was said to be half-conscious when rescued.
All four critical cases were being treated at United Christian Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
One of the others injured remained in a serious condition and another was stable.
