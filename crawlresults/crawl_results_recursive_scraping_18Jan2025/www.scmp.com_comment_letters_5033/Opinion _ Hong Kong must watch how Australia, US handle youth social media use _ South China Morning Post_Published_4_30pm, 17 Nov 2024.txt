Free societies might blanch at the thought of restricting media, but adults owe young people a duty of care when it comes to hard issues
The Australian government’s proposal would require all social media sites to verify users’ age, with tech companies that allow those under 16 to use their platforms being subject to penalties. Underage users and their parents would not be in breach.
The subject was discussed last week on an RTHK talk show I host. Timothy Hoffman, a local therapist who provides psychological counselling services, strongly supported the Australian move and said Hong Kong should seriously consider doing the same. He highlighted an article in The Atlantic magazine from September which reported how the founders and CEOs of major companies in the industry restrict their own children’s use of social media.
