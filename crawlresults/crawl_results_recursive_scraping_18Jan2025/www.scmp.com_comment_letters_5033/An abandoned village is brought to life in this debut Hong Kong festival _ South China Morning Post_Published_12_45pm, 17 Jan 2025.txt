The Countryside Harvest Festival takes place at the 400-year-old village of Kuk Po in Hong Kong’s far north
Having seen its fortunes rise and fall over a span of four centuries, the village of Kuk Po, in Hong Kong’s far north, is once again set for another transformation – this time, into an unlikely proponent of cultural and ecological exploration, with the debut edition of the Countryside Harvest Festival running until February 16.
The Countryside Harvest Festival features a series of events, exhibitions and performances under the theme of “Sound-Sight-Taste”. There’s a feast for the eyes as more than 20 art installations created in collaboration with local and international artists from Polytechnic University’s School of Design and inspired by Kuk Po’s historical charm will be displayed throughout the village.
Meanwhile, a photo exhibition organised by the Hong Kong International Photo Festival will showcase works from prominent photographers such as Changlin Fashi, Kelvin Yuen and Alfred Ko under the theme of returning home and reconnecting with one’s roots in a meditative treatise on the allure of the countryside in the modern era.
In a treat for the ears, a musical trio featuring World Harmonica Festival champion prizewinner Gordon Lee, multi-instrumentalist Vincent Liauw and singer Karen Kong will perform several sessions set amid Kuk Po’s abundant natural bounty.
Those looking for a bit more action can participate in a two-hour Gyrokinesis workshop that helps participants connect with nature through music, body movements and art, in an exploration of physical and mental states. Alternatively, a sunset tea-tasting session using leaves harvested from around the village and served in pottery made using Kuk Po soil provides a unique sense of terroir.
