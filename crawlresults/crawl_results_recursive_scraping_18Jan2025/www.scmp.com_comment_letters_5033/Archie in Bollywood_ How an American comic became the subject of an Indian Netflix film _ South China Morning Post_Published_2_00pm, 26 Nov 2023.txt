Cheerleading squads, trips to Pop Tates’ soda shop, feasting on burgers and hot dogs, love triangles, as well as academic challenges – the Archie comics, first produced in the 1940s, were iconic in the sense that they defined an entire American generation. Comics have always been an escape, and Archie was no exception.
Industry insiders say the Archie comics have long had a cultural impact in India, giving readers their first taste of American life and even influencing some Bollywood films.
“Are you ready to go back in time? Welcome toThe Archies,” Akhtar wrote in a post on her official Instagram account as she shared the trailer of the film.
The much-touted film will star actor Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan and film producer Boney Kapoor’s daughter Khushi Kapoor, as well as veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson Agastya Nanda.
