District councillors express concerns the proposed residential development may undermine art hub’s image
During a meeting of Yau Tsim Mong District Council’s housing and development planning committee on Thursday, some members raised concerns on future returns on the authority’s first residential project, seen as a financial lifeline for the cash-strapped arts hub.
They were scrutinising the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority’s plan to build seven residential buildings with a maximum of 1,995 flats, after the government last July allowed it to sell some of its land parcels to help it stay afloat.
District councillor Choi Siu-fung said the focus should be on culture and feared excessive property development could weaken the art hub’s positioning.
Wendy Gan Kim-see, the authority’s deputy CEO of development, pledged to organise more events to showcase the cultural aspects at a new shopping centre below the residential area, which is owned by the body.
“We have a certain level of influence that can lead to more cultural and artistic activities in the entire cultural district,” Gan said.
