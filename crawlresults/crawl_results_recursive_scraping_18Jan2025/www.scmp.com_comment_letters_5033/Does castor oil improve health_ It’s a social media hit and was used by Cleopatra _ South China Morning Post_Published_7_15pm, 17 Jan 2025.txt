Instagram and YouTube are full of praise for castor oil’s supposed health and wellness benefits, but a family doctor says to give it a miss
Castor oil, derived from the seeds of the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis), has a rich history as a health and wellness aid – and is now attracting widespread interest online.
In traditional Indian medicine Ayurveda, castor oil has been used for thousands of years to treat ailments from arthritis to skin problems.
Ancient Egyptians also used it for medicinal purposes. Cleopatra is said to have employed castor oil to brighten the whites of her eyes.
During the Middle Ages it was used in Europe as a remedy for constipation, and to induce labour – and is still sometimes used for these things.
