Former Hong Kong opposition lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun has died at the age of 55 after a battle with stomach cancer.
The career social worker died at 12.41am on Friday surrounded by family and friends, according to a post on his Instagram account.
“[Shiu] suffered from complications after gastric cancer surgery,” his wife Kelly said.
“Although he experienced hardships on the hospital bed, he always persevered and felt the guidance and care of the Heavenly Father, which enabled him to maintain inner peace even in difficult circumstances.
“Arrangements for the funeral service will be announced later.”
In a social media post last year, Shiu said he experienced gastrointestinal discomfort in October that was later diagnosed as stomach cancer.
