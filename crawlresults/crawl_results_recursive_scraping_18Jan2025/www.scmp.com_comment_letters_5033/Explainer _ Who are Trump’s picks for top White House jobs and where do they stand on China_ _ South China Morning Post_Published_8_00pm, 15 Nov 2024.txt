US president-elect Donald Trump starts filling his cabinet, and many chosen for key roles are known for tough stands on Beijing
US president-elect Donald Trump, known for valuing loyalty, has expressed regret over many senior officials from his last term who tried to thwart his often impulsive directives and ambitions.
Trump’s first administration was marked by turmoil and high turnover, with some former allies imprisoned for actions taken during his presidency, while others emerged as vocal critics. Only a handful remain on good terms with him, and some expect to be part of the new administration.
The new team is taking shape, with Trump announcing political advisers and allies for key roles as he prepares to take over from President Joe Biden on January 20.
The South China Morning Post looks at the early picks and top contenders for some of the key positions, from defence and diplomacy to trade and national security.
The former Trump campaign manager has been named White House chief of staff by the president-elect. She will be the first woman to serve in the post in American history.
But the low-key figure has shied away from the spotlight, rarely giving televised interviews and avoiding speaking engagements. She refused to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his win on election night. During Trump’s victory speech, he described Wiles as the “ice maiden” – referring to her composure – and said she “likes to stay in the background”.
