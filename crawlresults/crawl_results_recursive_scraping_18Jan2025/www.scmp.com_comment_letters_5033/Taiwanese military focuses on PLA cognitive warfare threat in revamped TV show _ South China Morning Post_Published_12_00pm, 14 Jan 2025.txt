Juguang Garden’s content gets hi-tech overhaul to cover Beijing’s misinformation campaigns, defence ministry says
The programme, which means “rejuvenation”, was designed to appeal to younger service members.
One of the key missions of the updated programme, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry, is educating soldiers about how to identify and respond to cognitive warfare waged by Beijing against the self-ruled island.
“Cognitive warfare is quietly unfolding in our daily lives. When the Chinese communists attempt to confuse and mislead us with disinformation, our minds become their ‘battlefield’,” the ministry said.
It added that the programme overhaul was meant to bolster the resolve of Taiwan’s military personnel and deny the PLA any opportunity to exploit the island’s defence forces in this “unseen battle”.
