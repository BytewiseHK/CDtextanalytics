Chinese users of Shanghai-based RedNote, also known as Xiaohongshu, welcome American arrivals to the platform
Many of TikTok’s American users began to anticipate a potential ban of the platform, fearing that the app’s Chinese ownership would become a critical point in the court’s decision.
US influencer Nuha – who has more than 1.5 million followers on TikTok and about 135,000 on Instagram – is among those signing up for RedNote’s blend of e-commerce and user-generated content.
“Hi guys, TikTok refugee here. I am so nervous to be on this app but I also find it to be really exciting and thrilling that we are all doing this,” said Nuha, in her first video posted to RedNote on Sunday.
