Luisa Tam details humans’ deep bond with the loyal creatures, and urges against abandoning them as if they were disposable
To many dog lovers, the 2009 Hollywood drama filmHachi: A Dog’s Talestarring Richard Gere epitomises the bond between humans and dogs.
Based on a true story, Hachi accompanied his master on his daily walk to the local railway station during the owner’s commute to work. Then the dog would always wait for him to return there so they could walk home together. Even years after his owner’s death, Hachi continued the daily ritual until his own passing.
Heart-warming tales of loyal dogs abound all over the world, illustrating the creatures’ love and selfless service of humankind. They embody unwavering devotion.
Dogs have lived alongside humans since the dawn of time, and scientists believe our bond with them goes as far back as 15,000 years. The love and friendship between man and dog is mutual; apparently when we make eye contact with a dog, they and we produce oxytocin – colloquially known as the “love hormone”. This process also takes place between mothers and newborns as they bond.
The benefits of social interaction between humans and dogs are indisputable. In short, they make us healthier and happier.
