The stability of Syria, at the heart of the Middle East, is in the interests of all. It is time for regional actors, not external ones, to lead the change
This crisis of uncertainty presents a historic opportunity for a geopolitical reconfiguration. In recent decades, the Middle East has experienced too many failed resets. It is time to alter course, reverse the cycle and for regional actors – not external players – to lead in shaping change.
Syria’s strategic geography gives it enormous leverage. It is a linchpin for regional security as it lies in the heart of the Middle East and borders several countries. All responsible states have a vested interest in Syria’s stability. Within this momentous context, the first foreign visit by a delegation of Syria’s transitional government to Saudi Arabia marked a major political breakthrough.
The objective is to prevent a proliferation of threats and spillover into Saudi Arabia and beyond. With its vast resources, the Saudis can play an indispensable role in Syria’s future, in particular replacing Iran as Syria’s chief energy supplier.
