Despite recent tensions between China and the Philippines, with the two sides increasingly squaring off over sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, diplomats are hoping to stem the tide of declining trade.
And they said these areas could include renewable energy, green metals manufacturing, agribusiness and food process, as well as electric vehicles and lithium batteries that have faced scrutiny from Western countries.
“The Philippines is committed to encouraging stable relations and close communication with regard to any issues related to bilateral trade and investments,” Emmanuel Ang, commercial counsellor of the Philippine embassy in China, told the Post by email.
“We anticipate that our trade relationship with our largest trading partner will remain robust, stable and steadily growing in the coming years.”
