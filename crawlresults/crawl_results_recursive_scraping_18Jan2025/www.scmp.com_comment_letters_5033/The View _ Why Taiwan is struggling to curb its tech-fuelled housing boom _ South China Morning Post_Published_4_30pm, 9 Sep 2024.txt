Housing has risen to the top of Taiwan’s policy agenda, but differences between the government and central bank are slowing progress
The facts speak for themselves. Although the pace of growth in prices and transactions have moderated somewhat, sales have increased sharply since the second half of last year. In the first seven months of 2024, Taiwan’s five big state-run banks extended NT$673 billion (US$21 billion) in new mortgage loans. This contributed to a rise in property lending to 37.4 per cent of banks’ total loans, just shy of the all-time high of 37.9 per cent.
