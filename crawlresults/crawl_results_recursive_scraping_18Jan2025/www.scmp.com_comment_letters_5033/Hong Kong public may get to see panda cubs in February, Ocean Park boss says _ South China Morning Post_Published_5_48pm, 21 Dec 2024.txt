Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong says he hopes the twins can be introduced to everyone after Lunar New Year
Panda lovers may be able to meet the Hong Kong-born twin cubs as soon as the Lantern Festival in February, Ocean Park’s chairman has said, while dismissing calls to sell cheaper tickets just to visit the bears.
Park chairman Paulo Pong Kin-yee said on Saturday that the panda twins – born in August – might be ready to meet the public around Lunar New Year.
“Our experts think that it’s a safer and a more appropriate time for the public to meet the cubs at the six-month mark. It will depend on how they slowly acclimatise to this,” Pong said.
“I personally hope that they could be introduced to everyone after Lunar New Year, perhaps at the Lantern Festival,” he added, referring to the last day of the new year celebrations which falls on February 12.
The park is now home to six pandas – Ying Ying, Le Le, their two cubs “Elder Sister” and “Younger Brother”, and two recently arrived adults gifted by Beijing, An An and Ke Ke.
Pong said visitors could expect “up-close” activities with the pandas next year such as making their snacks, washing bamboo leaves for them, or even making paper out of their excrement which had already been done last year.
