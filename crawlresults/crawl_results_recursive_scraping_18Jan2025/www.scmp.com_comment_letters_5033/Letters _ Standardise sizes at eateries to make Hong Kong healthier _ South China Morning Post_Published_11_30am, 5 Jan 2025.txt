Readers discuss ways to optimise food portion sizes in Hong Kong, the city’s first breast milk bank, and the benefits of admitting we’re not perfect
The restaurant trade, Environmental Protection Department, Department of Health and Consumer Council should work together to create specific definitions of what is “less rice” or “less sugar”, a standard or supersized dish, and other volumes and dimensions on a menu. While the choice is ultimately up to the consumer, a voluntary code on such standards would be beneficial.
There are some items that would present a challenge to definitions and might call for exceptions. There would be a good deal of difference in size between one lobster and one chicken if offered on a per-piece basis.
Such definitions could be accompanied by scoops or spoons tailored to add smaller amounts of ingredients during food preparation. Dishes, utensils and lunchboxes can be standardised to comply with the new definitions. Smaller operators may have much to learn from large chains such as McDonald’s or Café de Coral, where there are no surprises about how large a hamburger is or how much milk there is in a cup of hot milk tea.
Such an initiative would benefit the restaurant sector as it would push operators to define other taste-related parameters, enhancing their reputation for consistent quality. If more subjective aspects such as spiciness can be defined, weights and volumes should be easier to address.
