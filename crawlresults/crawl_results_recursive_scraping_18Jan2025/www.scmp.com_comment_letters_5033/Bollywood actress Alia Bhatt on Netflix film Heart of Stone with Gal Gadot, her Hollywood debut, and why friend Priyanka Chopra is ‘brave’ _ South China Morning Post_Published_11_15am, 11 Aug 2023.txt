Alia Bhatt had been weighing her Hollywood options for a few years. A popular star of Hindi films for over a decade with nearly 79 million Instagram followers, she had been interested in making an English-language film, but nothing had been working out.
“Your first film chooses you,” says Bhatt. “Technically, this is my first English-language movie. It chose me and I’m so happy it did.”
Heart of Stone, a globe-trotting spy thriller co-starring Gadot and Jamie Dornan, debuts globally on August 11 on Netflix. Bhatt’s role as a tech prodigy named Keya is one that is hard to describe without spoiling the twisty plot, but it is an important one.
In India, the actress had grown accustomed to being a lead, but here she was happy to delve into a more supporting part – as long as it had substance to it.
