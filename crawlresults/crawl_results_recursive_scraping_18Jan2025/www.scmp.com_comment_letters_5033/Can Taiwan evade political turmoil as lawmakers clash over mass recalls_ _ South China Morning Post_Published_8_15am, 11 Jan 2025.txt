As the DPP and KMT tussle over government’s mandate, each side threatens to oust lawmakers, fuelling worries over political stability
Taiwan’s main opposition and ruling parties this week appeared to back away from plans to launch mass recall campaigns against each other’s lawmakers, avoiding a direct showdown.
The flare-up erupted on January 4 when Ker Chien-ming, the DPP legislative caucus whip, announced a campaign to oust 41 opposition lawmakers from the 113-seat legislature.
“We must recall the 41 KMT legislators,” Ker declared, stressing that the DPP, with only 51 seats, had been unable to block opposition-sponsored proposals.
