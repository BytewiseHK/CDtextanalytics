Man, 79, hit by pieces of concrete and sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai on Friday evening
Contractors are carrying out work on a building in Hong Kongâ€™s bustling Causeway Bay shopping district after chunks of concrete broke off and hit an elderly man on the street.
Police said on Saturday that officers were alerted at 6.13pm the previous evening that concrete had fallen off a building at No 76 Percival Street.
A 79-year-old man was hit by pieces of concrete and sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai. He remained in hospital on Saturday.
The force said an initial investigation indicated that a piece of concrete of about 2.1 metres by 0.2 metres (6.9 feet by 0.7 feet) was suspected to have broken off a beam of the building.
The site was sealed off. Fragments of concrete could be seen scattered over the pavement in an area filled with shops including pharmacies.
In reply to inquiries by the Post, the Buildings Department said on Saturday that its personnel had found concrete was peeling off the exterior wall on the seventh floor of the building after an inspection following the incident.
