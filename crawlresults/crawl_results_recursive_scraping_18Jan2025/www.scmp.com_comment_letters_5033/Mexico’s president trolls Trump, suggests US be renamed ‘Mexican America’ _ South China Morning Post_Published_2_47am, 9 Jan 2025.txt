Claudia Sheinbaum was responding to the US president-elect’s proposal to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America instead
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to US president-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
Standing before a global map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed drily that North America should be renamed “América Mexicana”, or “Mexican America”, because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico’s constitution referred to it that way.
She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.
The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: how would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump’s strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?
Sheinbaum’s predecessor and political mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador – who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left – was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under US pressure, a boon to Trump.
But it was unclear if Mexico’s first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed López Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.
