Early contact with new administration seen as an important ‘window of opportunity’ for Beijing to help set the course of future relations
The period may provide an early test of the US president-elect’s approach towards China in his second term and this – as well as uncertainty over some of his policies – has led some observers to suggest that Beijing’s efforts to connect with Trump and his senior aides before he returns to the White House will help set the course for the relationship.
However, they do not expect these to have a far-reaching impact, given Trump’s “unpredictability” and deep-seated structural strains between the two powers.
Relations are expected to deteriorate further under Trump who is expected to take a hard line approach on issues such as Taiwan, the South China Sea and fentanyl, and may even revive the debate about the origins of Covid-19.
He has already pledged to impose new duties on Chinese products as soon as he takes office, raising questions about whether Beijing will retaliate with new restrictions of its own.
“If the opening phase proves that his policy is successful and effective, he is likely to continue on that path after the 100-day mark,” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the institute of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “If he feels that it has not had the desired effect, he may then begin to adjust it later on.”
Wu also said it was not clear what Trump’s priorities would be or what approach he would adopt to achieve his goals.
