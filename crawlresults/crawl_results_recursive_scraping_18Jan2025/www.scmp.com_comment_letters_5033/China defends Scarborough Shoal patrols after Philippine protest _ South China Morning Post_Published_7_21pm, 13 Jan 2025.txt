Beijing says its presence in the area is lawful while Manila says it is illegal and provocative
“The China Coast Guard conducts its patrols and law-enforcement activities in relevant waters, which is lawful, justified and beyond reproach,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Monday.
Guo urged Manila to “stop spreading malicious remarks and driving a wedge between China and other countries”.

The comments were in response to Manila’s denunciation of the weeklong presence of China’s coastguard in what the Philippines says is its exclusive economic zone and territorial waters.
“China should direct its vessels to desist from conducting illegal actions that violate the Philippines’ sovereign rights in its EEZ,” the National Maritime Council in Manila said on Monday.
The council said the Philippine Coast Guard immediately deployed vessels and aircraft when the “illegal” presence was detected.
