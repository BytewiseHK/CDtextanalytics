For all the magnanimity, nobility and divine right theory it preaches as it goes about unilaterally righting the world’s wrongs, the United States can be astonishingly bloody minded and ridiculously petty.
This was essentially state-sanctioned doxxing, and a manifestation of the mean, small-minded, schoolyard level of pettiness that is a hallmark of US President Donald Trump’s personal style, now being adopted wholesale by his administration in conducting international relations.
The usual bungling that is another trademark of the Trump administration was also on full display in getting Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor’s residential address wrong in the doxxing list. Lam mockingly likened it to how US authorities messed up Edward Snowden’s middle name in official documents, a discrepancy that Hong Kong cited as an excuse for not complying with Washington’s demands for his extradition when the former CIA analyst-turned-whistle-blower was hiding in the city back in 2013.
As the Trump administration brings out its many knives, sharp or blunt, to cut off Hong Kong’s nose just to spite China’s face, such is the zeal driving this unholy crusade against Beijing that it’s quite content to shoot itself in the foot during the process, pardon the mixed metaphors.
