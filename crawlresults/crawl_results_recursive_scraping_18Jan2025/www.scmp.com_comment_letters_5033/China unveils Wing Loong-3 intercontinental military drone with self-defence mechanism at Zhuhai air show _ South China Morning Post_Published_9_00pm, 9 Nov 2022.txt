The latest version in the Wing Loong drone series can fly a maximum range of 10,000km (6,200 miles) at medium altitude and has a 12.2-metre (40 feet) long main body and a 24-metre wingspan that enable it to fly long range while carrying heavy loads, according to Chinese state media.

State media reported that Wing Loong-3 could carry as many as 16 missiles and bombs.
Footage of the Wing Loong-3 on display in Zhuhai shows it is equipped with the PL-10E fourth-generation air-to-air strike missile, which Chinese analysts deem a significant improvement on the Wing Loong-1 and 2 models.
Yue Gang, a retired PLA colonel, said carrying PL-10E missiles meant the Wing Loong-3 could hit targets such as helicopters and UAVs, which “gives it a self-defence capability and improved its survivability”.
Compared with previous Wing Loong models, Yue said its larger size enables it to achieve long-range, heavy-loading and multitask performance.
Song Zhongping, a former PLA instructor, said its long endurance and heavy loads allowed the Wing Loong-3 to have a stronger strike capability.
