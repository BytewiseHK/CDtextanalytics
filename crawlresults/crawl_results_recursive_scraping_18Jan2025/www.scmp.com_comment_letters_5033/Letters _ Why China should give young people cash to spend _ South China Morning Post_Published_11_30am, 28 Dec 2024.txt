Readers discuss what is holding back China’s economic recovery, private school finances, and what makes Hong Kong a more attractive destination than Seoul or Tokyo
However, not all of Gao’s peers agree. Hong Hao, another economist who is popular on the internet, argued – hilariously – on Bloomberg Television that some of the elderly spending may be attributable to young people who, after all, receive pocket money from the generation of pensioners. It certainly reflects the lived experience of the different demographic groups in China.
Going by the two economists’ arguments, it would be quite reasonable to infer that China’s young people are willing to spend if they are able to. In the context of China’s downturn, it might be said that spending power is just not in the right hands.
Among older Chinese, there is a long-held habit of saving more or spending as little as possible. In effect, China’s welfare system is paying billions of yuan each year to those who are the best at saving money.
