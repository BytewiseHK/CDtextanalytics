“Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure.”
To think that just weeks ago this city was the envy of the world for its exemplary efficiency in handling the coronavirus crisis and its remarkable success in putting a lid on the scourge of our times. Not any more. Now we are staring into the abyss again. And we have no one to blame but ourselves.
I’m talking about streets filled with haj-sized crowds of shoppers and loiterers, commuters piling into trains and buses like lemmings, beaches packed to the gills with swimmers and sunbathers, bars and restaurants jammed with wining and dining enthusiasts, large social gatherings with people not giving a damn about wearing masks or avoiding handshakes and spraying saliva-filled conversations into each other’s faces at close range – sorry to say, social distancing was happening mostly on paper, not so much in practice.
