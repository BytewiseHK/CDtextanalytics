News of the joint crime-fighting effort comes after top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi urges Asean countries to crack down on cross-border fraud
Chinese and Thai police have worked together to detain 12 members of a crime ring accused of kidnapping six victims in Thailand and trafficking them to Myanmar as part of an employment and telecoms scam, state news agency Xinhua reported on Friday.
A model and a lighting engineer were among the other victims, according to Xinhua.
Wang’s story sparked a flood of reports on Chinese social media about similar cases, with many users claiming their friends and relatives had also disappeared near Myanmar’s border after being tricked into travelling to Thailand.
In response, China’s Ministry of Public Security said earlier this week that it had deployed security authorities to investigate the cases of citizens who had gone missing abroad.
