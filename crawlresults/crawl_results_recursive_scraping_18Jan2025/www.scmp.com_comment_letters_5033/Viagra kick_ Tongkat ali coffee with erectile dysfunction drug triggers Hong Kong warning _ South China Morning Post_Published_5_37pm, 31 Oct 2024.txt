“Sildenafil is a prescription drug used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and should only be used under a doctor’s advice and be supplied in a pharmacy under the supervision of a registered pharmacist upon a doctor’s prescription,” the department said on Wednesday.
Firstwell Tongkat Ali Premix Coffee is made in Malaysia, according to its packaging.
