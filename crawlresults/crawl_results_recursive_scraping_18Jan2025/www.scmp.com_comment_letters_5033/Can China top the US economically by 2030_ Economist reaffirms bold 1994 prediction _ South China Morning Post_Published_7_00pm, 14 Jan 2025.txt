Before US President Joe Biden’s attack on China’s growth prospects, Justin Lin Yifu said it was on track to becoming the world’s largest economy despite challenges, as ‘soldiers are met with generals, water with earth’
Speaking at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong on Monday, Lin, who served as the World Bank’s chief economist and senior vice-president from 2008-12, contended that while China’s annual gross domestic product growth has slowed, America’s economic growth rate has also decelerated.
“I believe, under normal circumstances, the forecast that China’s economy will surpass that of the US by 2030 – or by 2035 at the latest – based on market exchange rates, should remain unchanged,” said Lin, who is now an economics professor at Peking University.
“When I took office, you all recall, and the experts believed … it was inevitable that China’s economy would surpass ours. According to many predictions that would happen by the year 2030 or shortly thereafter,” Biden said in his farewell speech on Monday, adding: “Now, according to the latest predictions, on China’s current course, they will never surpass us.”
