In the wake of the shootings, I found myself shifting between hope and sadness. The hope came from the voices that surfaced in the multitude of protests in communities and cities across the country. It emerged from the messages sent out by various organisations and companies. I had not seen such a public outcry for Asian-Americans previously.
The hospital where my sister works issued the following statement: “Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center stands with the Asian community and rejects racism, violence and intolerance. We are united in working toward a more inclusive future. #StopAsianHate.” The hashtags were multiplying and posts crying out for solidarity were being shared again.
“The Asian-American community has reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored. What started out last January with dirty looks and verbal assaults has escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian-Americans,” said Representative Judy Chu, a Democrat from California.
