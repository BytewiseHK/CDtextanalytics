The Chinese e-commerce platform has soft-launched an English interface in Hong Kong
Chinese e-commerce giant Taobao has long been whispered about in certain circles as a Harry Potter-esque Room of Requirement, with everything from home furnishings and clothing, all the way to DIY Botox kits and romantic partners-for-rent – available for purchase with just the click of a button.
Now the shopping platform has quietly launched an English-language interface targeting English-speaking users. This includes features such as English product descriptions, local currency conversions and simplified navigation tailored to user preferences. New users can benefit from promotional offers, including discounts and free shipping on qualifying purchases.
Those looking to dive headlong into all that Taobao offers can navigate to the settings page after downloading the latest version of the app, then select Hong Kong from the country/region list, and English as the preferred language.
The resulting English interface is certainly rough around the edges, with the app relying heavily on translating Chinese text in real time, but it’s a start for many users who had to rely on friends, or even third-party services, to order from Taobao.
