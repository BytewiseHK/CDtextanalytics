The city’s ambitions to be one of the world’s premier aviation hubs takes a huge step forward this week with extended capacity
It took six years, HK$141.5 billion (US$18.1 billion), a reclamation project the equivalent of 34 Victoria Parks, and more than 100,000 tonnes of asphalt to build the 3.8km (2.4-mile) third runway and accompanying taxiway at Hong Kong International Airport.
While the work was done and the runway started operations in July 2022, the shutdown of the centre runway for reconfiguration prevented the whole system from operating at the same time.
That is all due for a welcome change on Thursday, when all three runways begin operating together for the first time.
For optimum efficiency, the new northern runway will be used for landing, the central runway for take-off, and the southern runway closest to Lantau Island for both.
The complex project also included an expanded second terminal and a new concourse, people mover and baggage handling system. It will allow the airport to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo each year.
Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki has described the construction feat as like building a whole new airport.
