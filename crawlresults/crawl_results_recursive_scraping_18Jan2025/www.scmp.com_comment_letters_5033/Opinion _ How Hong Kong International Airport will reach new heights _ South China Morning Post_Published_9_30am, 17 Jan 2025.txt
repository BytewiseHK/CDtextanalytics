The expansion of the airport’s services and facilities heralds new opportunities for China’s gateway to the world
Indeed, Skytopia builds on the legacies of Kai Tak and Hong Kong International Airport, tying the success of our city with the wider world. Passengers flying into Kai Tak bore exciting witness to an ever-expanding and never-sleeping city where towering buildings touch the sky.
Like Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong International Airport was founded at a pivotal moment in Hong Kong’s history. Creating extra legroom, it emulated the success of its predecessor, transforming Lantau Island and elevating Hong Kong’s fortunes to new heights.
It makes me proud that a Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department flight operation expert took part in the C919’s certification process. In October 2024, the Airport Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with aircraft manufacturer Comac to support C919 aircraft operations and promote them in overseas markets. With the three-runway system now in operation, the airport has even more headroom to expand supporting facilities for C919 maintenance.
However, a city is nothing without its people. In the wake of the C919’s inaugural flight, there is a growing need for maintenance personnel qualified to service the aircraft and the industry is actively training local engineers and mechanics. The Joint Maintenance Management Cooperation Arrangement – signed between the civil aviation authorities of the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau – enables holders of aircraft maintenance licences issued by the three authorities to work in the aircraft maintenance organisations located in the three places.
