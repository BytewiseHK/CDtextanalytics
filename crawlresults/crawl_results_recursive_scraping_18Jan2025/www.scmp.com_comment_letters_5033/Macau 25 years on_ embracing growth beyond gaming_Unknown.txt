The 25th anniversary of Macau’s return from Portuguese to Chinese administration provides a
			pivotal moment to reflect on the city’s dramatic transformation. Occupying just 33.3 sq km of
			land, Macau boasts a gaming industry two times larger than that of Las Vegas. The Post
			explains the city’s fascinating journey through the following charts and explores where its
			ambitious diversification plans are taking the casino hub.
Many of Macau's most notable casinos and resorts have been built on reclaimed land. The
				city's total land area grew a staggering 39.9 per cent over the past quarter century. The
				ambitious reclamation projects, mainly in Coloane, have spurred explosive economic
				development despite concerns about the ecological impact.
Macau’s population has grown by 59 per cent over the past 25 years, largely because of an
				influx of workers from mainland China. In 2023, one in four of Macau’s 683,700 population
				wereforeign workers. And they
				represent more than 40 per cent of the total workforce.
As the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal, Macau has become a popular
				destination for mainland tourists. Beijing’s support of Macau’s tourism-led services
				industry also accelerated growth. Since 2004,mainland touristshave outnumberednon-mainland visitors, peaking at 27.9 million in 2019. They now make up about 70 per cent of total visitors.
Macau’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is higher than that of mainland cities. Its
				residents have enjoyed annual handouts of 5,000 to 10,000 patacas since 2008, thanks to the
				flourishing gaming industry. In 2013, gross revenue fromgamblingpeaked at 360 billion patacas, nearly eight times that of the Las Vegas Strip that year and
				contributing 88 per cent of Macau's GDP.
But an anti-corruption campaign initiated by Beijing in 2015 deterred high-stakes gamblers,
				affecting gaming revenues ever since. The city’s reliance on the gambling sector also takes
				a heavy toll on society, prompting Beijing to ask Macau to “promote an optimal degree of
				industrial diversification” in its 11th five-year plan.
In 2023, Macau introduced a “1+4” diversification strategy to grow the city beyond gaming.
				The strategy aims to boost Macau’s function as “one centre” for integrated tourism and
				leisure, while four nascent industries should be further developed to help the economy
				become more resilient.

For decades, Macau's gambling industry operated under a monopoly, with 300 gaming tables
				recorded in 1999. The year 2002 was a turning point as the government introduced
				competition, breaking the monopoly of the casino empire built by “gambling king” Stanley Ho
				Hung-sun.
Since then, the number of gaming tables has skyrocketed, peaking at 6,739 in 2019 before the
				pandemic. In 2022, six casino operators secured new 10-year concessions, three of which are
				still owned by the Ho family.
