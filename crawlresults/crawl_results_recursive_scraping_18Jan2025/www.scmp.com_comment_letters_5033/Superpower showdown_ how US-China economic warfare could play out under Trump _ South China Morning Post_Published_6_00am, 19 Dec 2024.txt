As US president-elect Donald Trump forms his hawk-filled cabinet, what might China do to counter and deflect a barrage of blows?
After retaking the White House last month, US president-elect Donald Trump celebrated his victory by attending an Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight bout with his friend and UFC president, Dana White, alongside billionaire ally Elon Musk.
And some say that China, which has maintained a stable team of loyalists to President Xi Jinping and gained experience with Trump in his first term, may respond with more composure – as demonstrated in the ancient Chinese martial art of tai chi – while trying to dissolve attacks from the United States.
Vice-Premier He Lifeng, who has been the “Chinese lead in US economic and trade talks” since last year, is expected to play a pivotal role in dealing with what looks to be shaping up as a fresh round of trade contentions.
Unlike when Trump first entered politics and had to rely on the opinions of establishment Republicans, his strong return has elevated loyalty to his primary criterion for selecting candidates, aiming to minimise any constraints on presidential power.
