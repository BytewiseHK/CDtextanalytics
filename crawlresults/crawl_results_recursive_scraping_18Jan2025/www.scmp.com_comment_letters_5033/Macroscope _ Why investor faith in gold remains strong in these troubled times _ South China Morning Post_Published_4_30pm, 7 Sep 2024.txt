The gold price coming adrift from traditional anchors points to deep uncertainty about the world and concern for the global monetary system
The price of the precious metal has surged, to the point where the value of a single ounce has exceeded a record US$2,500 on some days in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the cost of a 400-ounce gold bar has reached US$1 million for the first time.
The fact that the gold price has apparently come adrift from traditional anchors or benchmarks points not only to deep uncertainty on the part of central banks and investors about the state of the world but also to growing concerns over the condition of the global monetary system.
