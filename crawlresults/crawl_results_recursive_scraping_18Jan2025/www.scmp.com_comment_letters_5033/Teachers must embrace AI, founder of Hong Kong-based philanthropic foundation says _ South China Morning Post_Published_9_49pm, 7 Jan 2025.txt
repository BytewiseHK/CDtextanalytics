Tencent co-founder Charles Chen Yidan calls on educators to explore how AI can improve not only learning but also their own skills
Charles Chen Yidan, a co-founder of technology conglomerate Tencent, said on Tuesday that educators should use AI to their advantage, given its inevitable impact on schools and learning.
“We should be cautious and not only be in awe of AI products and turn a generation into guinea pigs of the technology, but actively embrace and monitor the outcomes,” he said. “We should experiment and explore the tool to derive joy and improvements to our productivity.”
He was speaking at a panel on education at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University with president Paul Lam Kwan-sing.
Chen left Tencent in 2013 and founded his philanthropic foundation in 2016.
Widely regarded as the world’s highest education accolade, the Yidan Prize Foundation recognises individuals and teams who have made outstanding contributions to improving education.
