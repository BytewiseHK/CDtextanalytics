For Hong Kong, sky is literally the limit if city’s carriers can offer competitive fares, top-notch services and a wide variety of destinations
Airlines deserve praise for earning top places in global rankings, and honours recently earned by HK Express should put wind beneath the wings of the Hong Kong carrier well into the new year. The win must also push the city to aim higher as it charts a course for international aviation hub success.
The budget arm of Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways was crowned world’s “fastest-growing airline of 2024” after recording a 40 per cent increase in passenger numbers over the previous year with 6 million travellers.
Travel data provider OAG said the carrier boosted the number of flights last year by 46 per cent to 35,015, partly due to the expansion of its network and fleet. Industry experts predict the upwards trend will continue for low-cost airlines this year, as a strong Hong Kong dollar and fading pandemic memories encouraged travel.
HK Express has capitalised on the trends with some clever moves. A comprehensive network in Japan including direct flights to new destinations like Shizuoka has made it a top choice for leisure travellers.
Its low-fare pricing strategies have caught widespread attention and growth as passengers snapped up eye-popping deals including a HK$10 return trip between Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Dr Andrew Yuen Chi-lok, executive director of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Aviation Policy Research Centre, said prospects were looking up for local budget airlines as good slots open thanks to the third runway at Hong Kong International Airport.
