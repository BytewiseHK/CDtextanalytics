“What lies ahead in 2021 we have yet to know, but we must have done great if we’re still alive when 2020 ends!”
With just 10 days to go before we usher in a new year, this seems to be the general sentiment across the city as it battles a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic with no end in sight, while global geopolitical uncertainties keep growing.
No one has a crystal ball to predict the future, but any responsible government should rethink, reassess, and plan ahead strategically, for better or worse.
After a three-day, high-level conference, the top Beijing leadership last week outlined eight major tasks to ensure future economic growth with a clear “no policy U-turn” pledge.
Major initiatives included kicking off a comprehensive antitrust campaign to prevent “disorderly expansion of capital”, strengthening core technology development, ensuring more self-controlled supply chains, and safeguarding grain supplies.
China, by now, is the first country to see its economy picking up after the devastating Covid-19 outbreak due to its strict, top-down, pandemic-control measures. But it will take a while to conclude whether that signals an economic rebound or a definite recovery, taking into consideration the much-deteriorated Sino-US relations.
