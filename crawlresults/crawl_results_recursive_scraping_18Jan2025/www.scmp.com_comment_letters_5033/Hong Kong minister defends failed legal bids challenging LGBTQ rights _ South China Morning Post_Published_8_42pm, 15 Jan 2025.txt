Regina Ip asks justice minister Paul Lam whether officials will be held accountable for litigation expected to have ‘low success rate’
Hong Kong’s justice minister has defended his department’s failed legal attempts to challenge the rights of same-sex couples amid calls from a top government adviser for officials to be held accountable for pursuing cases that were expected to have a “low success rate”.
“There is in particular the need to take into account the overall public interest, such as the potential political, social and economic impacts, as well as the profound effects on the use and allocation of limited and valuable public resources if the judicial review is successful,” Lam said.
“For significant issues, an appeal process must be undertaken so as to obtain a final and authoritative ruling on the issue in dispute. More significantly, the most important aspect of litigation, aside from the outcome, is the reasoning of the judgments.”
