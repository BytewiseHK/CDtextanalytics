Internationally, the sector is growing rapidly in terms of investment and adoption. Farmers are facing increased pressure to feed a global population that is forecast to reach 10 billion by 2050. In the Asia-Pacific region, the sector is already taking off in the form of industry conferences, investment and accelerator programmes in markets in Singapore and Australia.

Agtech can potentially be a spark in further fuelling the local and regional economy.
