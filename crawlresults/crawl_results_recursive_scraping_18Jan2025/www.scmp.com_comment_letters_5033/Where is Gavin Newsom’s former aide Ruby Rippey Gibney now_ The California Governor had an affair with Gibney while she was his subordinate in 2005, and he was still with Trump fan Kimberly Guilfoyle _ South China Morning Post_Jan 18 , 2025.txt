As people search for someone to blame for the Los Angeles wildfires, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s character is being scrutinised – including decisions he previously made in his love life
California governor Gavin Newsom is no stranger to controversy.
The politician admitted that he never attended a formal rehabilitation programme for alcohol abuse after his affair with his best friend’s wife came out, despite publicly claiming that he would, per the Daily Mail. “There’s no rehab. I just stopped,” he told the Sacramento Bee in 2018. “There was no treatment, no nothing related to any of that stuff. I stopped because I thought it was a good thing to stop.”
“There is no 12-step [programme] here,” he added. “There are no issues with that. There never was. This was a need to reset.”
Talk of his affair from over a decade ago has resurfaced amid his response to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires as Governor of California.
While we know plenty about Newsom and his life in the public eye, what ever happened to Rippey Gibney? Here’s what we’ve gathered.
Rippey Gibney was working as Newsom’s appointments secretary from February 2004 to August 2006, per The Org. She was married to his former campaign manager, Alex Tourk, while Newsom was in the process of divorcing Guilfoyle, notes Reuters.
