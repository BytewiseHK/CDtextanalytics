New controls go beyond China, setting quotas for about 120 countries; exports to 18 allies including Japan, UK, the Netherlands are exempt
Moving to fortify tough technology restrictions on China on its way out the door, US President Joe Biden’s administration announced new regulations on Monday designed to further restrict artificial intelligence chip exports.
The new rules, formulated to draw a clearer line between allies and adversaries, aim to divide the world into areas with access to the latest US advanced computing power, including American companies and those from allied countries, and those areas where it is restricted – primarily China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The extensive new rules, released one week before Biden steps down, are designed to maintain the US’ lead in the development of AI – not only compared with China, but globally.
As outlined, these restrictions would cap AI chips and technology exports to most countries; completely block these exports to China and the three other adversaries; and allow nearly unlimited access for Washington’s closest allies.
“The US leads AI now – both AI development and AI chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way,” US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters in advance of the announcement.
The administration of incoming president Donald Trump, which assumes power on January 20, has not weighed in on the new rules. And under the US Commerce Department procedures, the regulations do not take effect for 120 days, giving Trump time to weigh in.
