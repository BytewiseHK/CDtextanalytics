Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen model will enable the GenAI features of the Phantom V Fold2, Transsion’s latest 5G smartphone under its Tecno brand
The two firms’ on-device GenAI service makes use of a so-called AI button, which enables a user to conduct multiple rounds of AI conversations and quickly make summaries of documents and phone call messages.
In the Alibaba Cloud statement, Shi said the “optimisation of inferencing energy consumption” has become a major challenge for integrating AI models on devices. AI inferencing is the process that a trained model uses to draw conclusions or solve tasks based on brand-new live data.
