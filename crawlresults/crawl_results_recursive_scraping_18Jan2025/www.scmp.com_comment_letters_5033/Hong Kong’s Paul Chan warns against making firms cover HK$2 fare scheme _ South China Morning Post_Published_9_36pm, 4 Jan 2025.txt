Finance chief also say authorities are still conducting review of concessionary fare scheme for elderly, disabled residents
Hong Kong’s finance chief has cautioned against asking transport operators to cover the cost of the city’s HK$2 (26 US cents) concessionary fare scheme for elderly and disabled residents, saying it may lead to higher ticket prices for other commuters.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po also said authorities were still reviewing the scheme, which cost taxpayers nearly HK$4 billion in the last financial year.
In his budget speech last February, the minister had announced a review of the scheme would be completed within 2024.
“We have heard many different opinions in newspapers and media. Colleagues from the Labour and Welfare Bureau are also conducting research,” he said on Saturday during a televised consultation session for his coming budget speech.
“We will make a decision after collecting public views and conducting research.”
At the session, an elderly audience member said authorities could not be “capricious” when it came to welfare spending.
