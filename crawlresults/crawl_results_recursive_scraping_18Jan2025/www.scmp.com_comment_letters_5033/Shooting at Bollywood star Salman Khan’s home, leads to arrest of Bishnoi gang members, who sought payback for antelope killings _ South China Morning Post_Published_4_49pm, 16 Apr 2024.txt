Two members of a notorious criminal gang were arrested by Indian police on Tuesday for firing at the home of Bollywood actor Salman Khan in retaliation for the superstar’s killing of two antelopes.
The Bishnoi gang, accused of several murders and extortion rackets, hails from a wider desert-based religious sect that considers the species to be the reincarnation of their guru.
Khan, 58, has been in the cross hairs of the group since 1998 for shooting two black bucks on a recreational hunting trip.
The gang’s jailed leader Lawrence Bishnoi has threatened Khan with assassination in the past.
Two men on a motorbike shot at Khan’s first-floor flat during the early hours of Sunday in the upscale Mumbai neighbourhood of Bandra, also firing several rounds in the air before fleeing.
