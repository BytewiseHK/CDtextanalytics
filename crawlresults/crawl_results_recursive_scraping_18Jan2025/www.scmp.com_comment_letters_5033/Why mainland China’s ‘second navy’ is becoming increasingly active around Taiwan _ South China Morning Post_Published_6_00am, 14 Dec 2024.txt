As well as stepping up patrols, coastguards are training with the navy triggering speculation about their role in any attack on the island
The coastguard is central to Beijing’s grey-zone tactics – which are designed to intensify the pressure on the island while falling short of full-blown warfare – and has been carrying out regular patrols around Taiwan in the hope this is less likely to trigger a strong response than the use of the navy would.
Beijing has said these patrols are intended to “maintain operational order in sea areas and safeguard fishermen’s lives and property”.
The China Coast Guard’s [CCG] combat readiness is at “a low to medium level”, according to Lyle Goldstein, director of the China Initiative at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.
