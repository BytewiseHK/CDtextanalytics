The US is lagging behind its main rival when it comes to dual-use drones that play a key role in many aspects of modern warfare
Drones could be a central plank of the president-elect’s “America first” agenda, but some observers have said that US commercial drones would be too expensive to compete with those made in China.
Others have said further trade restrictions would have a limited impact on China’s dominance in the industry despite Trump’s promise to jack up tariffs on Chinese goods.
The use of drones designed to capture wide-view photos and footage with a first-person view has become widespread among rescue services and mappers as well as ordinary members of the public.
However, they also have a military use and have featured extensively on battlefields in the Middle East and Ukraine.
