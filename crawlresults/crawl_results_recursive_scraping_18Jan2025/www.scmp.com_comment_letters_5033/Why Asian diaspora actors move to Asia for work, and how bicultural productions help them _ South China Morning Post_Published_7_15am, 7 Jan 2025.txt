Producers in Asia and North America collaborate on projects to give global exposure to Asian actors, including some born in the West
Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Canada, Thomas Lo is giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.
The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the city’s biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content for viewers around the world.
“It was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,” Lo says. “You see more Asians but you’re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We’re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it’s not just in front of the camera. It’s behind the camera as well.”
Working as an Asian actor in North American hubs – Toronto, Los Angeles, New York – is different to working in Asian locations, such as Hong Kong or Taipei.
Actors in Asia deal less with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenised. Historically, many Asian-American and Canadian actors have relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.
