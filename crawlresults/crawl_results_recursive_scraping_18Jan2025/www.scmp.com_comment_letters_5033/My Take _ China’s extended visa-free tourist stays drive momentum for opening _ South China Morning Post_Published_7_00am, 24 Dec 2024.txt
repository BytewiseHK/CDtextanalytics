Its latest foreign-visitor policy shows that China is willing to be pragmatic, rather than adhering strictly to ideologies
It is worth noting that half of China’s territory is now open to citizens from developed economies. These include the nation’s most populous areas, its economic and political heartlands, and hundreds of cities. Places still off-limits to visa-free exploration include Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, as well as Jilin, China’s border province with North Korea.
But more than that, the policy also reflects a subtle shift in Beijing’s thinking: policymakers are a bit concerned, to say the least, about China’s reduced interactions with the rest of the world.
Those policies have worked. The number of foreign-passport holders entering China reached 29 million in the first 11 months of 2024, a hefty increase of 86 per cent from the same period last year. Still, it should be noted that the flow was much thinner than pre-Covid levels. In 2019, China recorded 98 million entries and exits by foreigners, which translated to about 49 million entries.
