Congress was notified of the US$80 million deal on Wednesday, a State Department spokesperson said, speaking on background. The structure of the sale, using a provision known as Foreign Military Financing (FMF), was expected to anger China, which considers the self-governed island part of its territory.
“This is the first-ever FMF provision to Taiwan,” the spokesperson said. “The United States makes available to Taiwan defence articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defence capability.”
Previous military sales to Taiwan have been approved under other mechanisms that do not necessarily imply statehood. US officials said the funding provision did not represent a change in its one-China policy.
FMF is a “critical foreign policy tool” to ensure that “coalition partners and friendly foreign governments are equipped and trained to work toward common security goals”, according to the US Defense Department website.
Analysts said the deal is part of Washington’s evolving relationship with Taiwan as the US increasingly focuses on the Indo-Pacific region.
