A rally attendee died and two were critically wounded in the incident.
Trump, 78, posted on Truth Social, saying: “I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.
“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening,” Trump said.
“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country,” he said.
