I was recently invited by a friend to co-lead a group of scouts on weekends. During these sessions, I observed that my friend’s teaching style was notably hands-off.
One weekend, he decided to teach the scouts how to set up a tent. Rather than start with detailed instructions, he let them figure it out on their own first. They proceeded to assemble the tent upside down. When I moved to correct them, my friend held me back: he wanted to give them the chance to realise their error before we stepped in.
Intrigued, I asked why. His laid-back answer that “it’s not a big deal if they set up the tent upside down” made me reconsider my way of dealing with errors, especially with those I guide.
At home in Hong Kong, children are often scolded for making errors in schoolwork, housework and other tasks. Mistakes are still often seen as harmful to academic performance or efficiency, resulting in criticism and discouragement. As an accounting tutor, I myself emphasise meticulous instruction due to the critical nature of the Diploma of Secondary Education examinations.
