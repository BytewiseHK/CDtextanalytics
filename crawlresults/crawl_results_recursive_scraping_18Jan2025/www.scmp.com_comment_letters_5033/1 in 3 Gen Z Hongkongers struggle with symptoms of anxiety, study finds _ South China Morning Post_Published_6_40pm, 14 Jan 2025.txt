Researchers behind study have called for more emotional education and resilience training in schools
Nearly one in three Gen Z Hongkongers suffer from symptoms of anxiety, the highest rate among all age groups, a joint university study has found, with researchers calling for more emotional education and resilience training in schools.
The study conducted by Hong Kong Shue Yan University and four other institutions also found people aged between 17 and 27 had the lowest scores in emotional regulation and positive life outlook compared with other age groups.
Professor Catherine Tang So-kum, a distinguished professor of psychology at the university, said on Tuesday that Gen Z Hongkongers were the most severely affected by anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms among all generational groups.
“Gen Z is 1.74 times more likely to report anxiety symptoms compared with other generations. They are also 1.41 times more likely to report depression symptoms than other generations,” she said.
Tang said the first phase of the study focused on the symptoms participants faced, and the second part, which would be released in two years’ time, would delve into the causes of those mental health issues.
“There are many reasons and one of them is that … Gen Z is a younger generation and they may be more open to talking about themselves. They may be more willing to disclose to others about their emotional well-being,” she said.
