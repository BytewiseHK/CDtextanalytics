While it is a tradition to fill red paper envelopes with freshly printed notes, mainland Chinese have shown sustainable digital options can be just as effective
A new year heralds not just new hopes and adventures, but also changes for the better. The same goes for the Chinese tradition of giving lai see during the Lunar New Year.
As citizens queued up again for crisp banknotes to fill red packets, or hong bao in Mandarin, let us not forget to go green and opt for alternatives such as electronic payments as well as used envelopes and banknotes.
The appeal to mark the Lunar New Year in a more environmentally friendly manner has been made for years, though the majority of the public still adheres to the older convention, as reflected in the crowds for new notes across Hong Kong in recent days. Some banks have also stocked up on cash in anticipation of higher demand this year.
The phenomenon, albeit not unusual, sits oddly with the move towards a cashless society and sustainable living.
Admittedly, the preference to fill red packets with new notes is not something that can be easily changed. Meanwhile, banks, malls and private companies are also reinforcing the customs by giving out free envelopes with special themes and designs as a marketing ploy to promote their services, products or brand.
