Here’s what we know about the enigmatic man who reportedly calls himself a “liver” (because he’s living, obviously), has a “relevance room” parodyingScream Queens, and charges around US$35,000 to appear at parties.
The name Orhan has Turkish roots and, according to an interview he gave to MensXP, means “leader of the Turkish people”. However, his parents are from Mumbai, India, and he was raised in Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu. He describes growing up in the town as “cute”, “very American” and “very humble”.
In terms of education, he went to a boarding school in Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadu, per GQ India, and later studied at New York’s Parsons School of Design, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in fine arts and communication design, reports Mashable. Per his interview with MensXP, he has studied in Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, Connecticut, New York and London. However, he considers himself a “graduate from the school of life”.
While he refuses to reveal his age, he has mentioned that he is “borderline Gen Z” and is over 25 years old, per Times of India.
