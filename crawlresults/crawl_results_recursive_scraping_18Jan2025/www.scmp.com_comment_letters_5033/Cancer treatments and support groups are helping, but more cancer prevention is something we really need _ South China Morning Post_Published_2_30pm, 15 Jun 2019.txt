This past May was my sixth “cancerversary” and, compared to the previous year, it was fairly low-key.I marked it with a silent prayer for friends lost over the years to this disease. Many were similar to me when diagnosed – in their 30s and juggling work, family and friends. We felt immortal, our personal and professional lifestyles on the fast track.
But the focus on the five-year milestone is limiting, especially with advancements in science, innovation and technology – specifically social media and video – allowing us to readily share information.
With the sixth anniversary, I had a light-bulb moment. Why not extend the fight to breast cancer prevention research? Meaning identifying and spotlighting areas in the environment and lifestyle that could play a factor. Why not create initiatives, programmes and innovations to bring awareness and introduce advocacy to women of all ages and ethnicities? Why not start education and awareness as early as secondary school?
I was 37 and working in Hong Kong when I found a large lump in my left breast. I had no family history and lived a fairly healthy lifestyle. One doctor said the root of the disease was stress, another theorised that it was too much ice cream. In other words, no definitive answer.
