Hong Kong government document on how to increase visitor numbers can only go so far in an industry that is constantly changing
When the Hong Kong government last mapped out an ambitious tourism strategy in 2017, it could hardly foresee that much of it would be torn up by a devastating global pandemic.
So when a new blueprint is released under the shadow of a slow post-Covid recovery, the city may only hope for the best.
Encompassing four development strategies, 16 implementation directions, 59 action plans and 133 measures to reinforce the city’s role as a travel hub, the “Development Blueprint for Hong Kong’s Tourism Industry 2.0” is a welcome move.
Among the themes floated to help attract more visitors are pandas, horse racing, cruises, yachting, nature and mega-events.
They will be supported by innovation and technologies to provide travellers with convenience, including smart check-in kiosks at the airport, e-channel entry and exit, electronic payments, as well as augmented reality features at attractions.
In addition to diversifying the market and attracting more high value-added overnight visitors, the cruise industry will be reinforced, including strengthening partnerships with mainland and regional ports, exploring offshore berthing at green locations in the city for expedition cruises and a makeover for the underutilised terminal at Kai Tak.
