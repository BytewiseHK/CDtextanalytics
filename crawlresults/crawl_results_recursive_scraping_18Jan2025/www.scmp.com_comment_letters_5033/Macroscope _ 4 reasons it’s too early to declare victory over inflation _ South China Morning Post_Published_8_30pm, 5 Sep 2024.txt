Central banks might have kept interest rates too high for too long. Cutting them too quickly could prove even more costly
The facts speak for themselves. In September 2022, inflation in the United States and the euro zone stood at 8.2 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively. Fast forward two years and consumer prices in both economies are below 3 per cent, only slightly above the 2 per cent inflation target.
Inflation in developing countries has also fallen sharply. The average inflation rate in emerging markets, weighted according to the size of the economy, has fallen from 7.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent, according to data from JPMorgan.
