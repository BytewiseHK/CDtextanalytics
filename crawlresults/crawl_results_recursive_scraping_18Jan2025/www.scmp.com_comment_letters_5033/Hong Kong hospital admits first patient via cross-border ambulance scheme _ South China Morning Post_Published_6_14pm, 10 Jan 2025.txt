Patient with chronic bronchitis transferred from University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in Futian to Tuen Mun Hospital
A 67-year-old man with chronic bronchitis has become the first patient to be transferred directly from Shenzhen in mainland China to Hong Kong by ambulance under a new pilot scheme to foster deeper collaboration in the Greater Bay Area.
The Hospital Authority said on Friday the transfer went smoothly and that the patient, who holds a Hong Kong identity card, was currently receiving treatment at Tuen Mun Hospital.
Dr Michael Wong Lap-gate, the authority’s director of quality and safety, said the patient was admitted to the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital in Futian district on Tuesday due to respiratory failure.
“After two days, his condition became stable, and he expressed that he wished to continue his treatment in Hong Kong. The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital sent us a request yesterday,” he said.
“The doctors on both sides have looked at the case and thought it would be suitable for the cross-boundary ambulance transfer. Thus, we reported to the relevant authorities and received the approval. We have arranged for the patient to be transferred to Tuen Mun Hospital today.
“The patient is now receiving treatment in the ward. The whole process was very smooth.”
