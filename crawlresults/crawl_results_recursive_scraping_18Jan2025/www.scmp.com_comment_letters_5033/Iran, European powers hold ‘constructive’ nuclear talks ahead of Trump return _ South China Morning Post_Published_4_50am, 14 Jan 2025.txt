Iran and European powers hold talks in Geneva on lifting sanctions and nuclear issues
Iran and European powers said they held “frank and constructive” talks on Monday about Tehran’s nuclear programme, just a week before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
It was the second round of such talks in less than two months, following a discreet meeting in Geneva last November between Tehran and the three European powers, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3.
Few details were revealed about the topics discussed Monday or even the venue of the talks, but both sides said they were “constructive” and that the parties agreed to carry them on.
Iran’s ISNA news agency reported that Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi met “his counterparts from the E3”.
“They discussed issues of mutual interest, including negotiations for lifting sanctions, the nuclear issue and the worrying situation in the region,” it added without elaborating.
