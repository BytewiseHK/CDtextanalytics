Sanctioned by the West and unsure of Russiaâ€™s support, Belarus is banking on economic ties with China as Lukashenko plans pre-election visit
Previously, in 2017 and 2018, amid oil and gas disputes between Minsk and Moscow, Lukashenko attempted to normalise relations with the European Union. That was part of his tactic of threatening Moscow with closer ties with the West unless Belarus received cheaper energy. It proved successful. To this day, the Kremlin provides cheap oil and natural gas to its nominal ally, and keeps the Russian market open for Belarusian goods.
