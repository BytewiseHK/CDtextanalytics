The renowned biostatistician has left Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia for a full-time post with her prestigious alma mater in Beijing
Renowned biomathematician Hu Yijuan has returned to China and joined the prestigious Peking University – her alma mater – after nearly two decades in the United States.
Hu took up a full-time post at the Beijing International Centre for Mathematical Research at the university in July, after leaving Emory University School of Public Health, where she was a professor of biostatistics.
A blog that covers academic news in China said on Monday that Hu – who is also part of the university’s biostatistics department – made the move last year, a report that appears to be supported elsewhere online.
According to a biography posted online by Tsinghua University – where she gave a guest lecture in November – Hu graduated from Peking University in 2005 and completed her PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before joining Emory in 2011.
It is unclear when Hu left the private university in Atlanta, Georgia, which shot to prominence in 2019 for abruptly sacking two neuroscientists for alleged undisclosed links to China, which they strongly denied.
The initiative was discontinued under President Joe Biden but not before many ethnically Chinese scientists lost their positions or chose to leave the US amid accusations of racial profiling.
