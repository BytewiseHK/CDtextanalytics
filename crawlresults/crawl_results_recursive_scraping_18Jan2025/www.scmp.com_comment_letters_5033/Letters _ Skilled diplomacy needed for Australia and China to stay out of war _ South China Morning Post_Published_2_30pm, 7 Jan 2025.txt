Readers discuss a foreign policy dilemma facing Australia, and consequences of US foreign policy
It underscores the need for these countries to adhere firmly to their national interest in not being drawn into an unnecessary and devastating military conflict between the two superpowers.
For Australia, this threatens an acute dilemma testing our relationship with both superpowers depending on what stance the White House under Donald Trump decides to take in its relationship with China.
At present, Australia is indicating its resolve to continue to pursue rapprochement with China while remaining a trusted ally of America in line with our treaty commitments.
Our government has, using diplomatic language, made it clear that it will not automatically be “all the way with the USA” in our international relations including our China relationship.
But there may well be very considerable tension – at worst outright contradiction – between those two commitments and it remains to be seen to what degree we can continue to balance these two imperatives with a Trump administration in the United States.
