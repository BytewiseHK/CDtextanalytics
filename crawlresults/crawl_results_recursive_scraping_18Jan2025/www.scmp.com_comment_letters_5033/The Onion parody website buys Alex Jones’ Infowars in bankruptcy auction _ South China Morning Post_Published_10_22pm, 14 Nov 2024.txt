Satirical publication plans ‘less hateful disinformation’ for Infowars, which for decades has peddled in conspiracies
Like a headline lifted from the Onion, the parody news website is buying conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ Infowars in a bankruptcy auction.
The Onion said in a statement on Thursday it aims to replace Infowars’ “relentless barrage of disinformation” with the Onion’s “noticeably less hateful disinformation”.
“The Onion is proud to acquire Infowars, and we look forward to continuing its storied tradition of scaring the site’s users with lies until they fork over their cold, hard cash,” the Onion CEO Ben Collins said in a statement.
Financial terms were not disclosed, and are subject to future approval by a US bankruptcy judge in Houston. Infowars’ website was shut down on Thursday and the Onion said it aimed to relaunch the platform in January.
US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, who is overseeing Infowars’ bankruptcy, said he had some concerns about the transparency of the auction at a court hearing late Thursday.
