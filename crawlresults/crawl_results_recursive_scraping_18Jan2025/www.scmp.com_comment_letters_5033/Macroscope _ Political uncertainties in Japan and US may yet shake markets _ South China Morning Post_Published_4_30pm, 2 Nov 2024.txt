Tokyo’s power vacuum, and questions over Japan’s policies and its relationship with the US under Harris or Trump, could have deeper economic impacts
In 1983, Japan’s prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone reportedly likened the country to an “unsinkable aircraft carrier”, as a base for US strategic interests in Asia. But Japan now seems to be doing its best to scuttle itself politically, given the results of the election on October 27 called by new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
