The FBI is offering up to US$50,000 for information leading to the capture of the gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare’s Brian Thompson
New York’s mayor said on Saturday that “the net is tightening” on the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive before fleeing the city.
Mayor Eric Adams also said detectives knew the name of the fresh-faced suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators on Thursday and who has now been on the run for almost four days.
Adams praised “the manner in which [investigators] were able to follow his footsteps to recover evidence – some of it is known, some of it is unknown – but the net is tightening and we’re going to bring this person to justice”, he said, according to a report in the New York Post.
The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a northern neighbourhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday’s slaying, but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police spokesman said.
“They believe he’s not in New York City,” the spokesman added.
The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist.
