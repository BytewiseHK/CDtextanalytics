A paper published in the Chinese journalElectronic Information Warfare Technologydid not give details of the timing and location of the experiment, which are classified but it may be the country’s first openly reported field test of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon.
The latest experiment, carried out by the defence contractor China Electronics Technology Group (CETEC), concentrated on a larger, single aircraft which was brought down while flying 1,500 metres (4,920ft) above sea level.
“It will put us on par with the Americans,” said Professor Gao Huailin and colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the paper published inScientia Sinica Physica, Mechanica & Astronomicaon Tuesday.
