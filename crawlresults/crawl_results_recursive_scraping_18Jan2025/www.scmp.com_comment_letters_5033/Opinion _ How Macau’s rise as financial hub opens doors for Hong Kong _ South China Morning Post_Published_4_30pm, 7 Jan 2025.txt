With its robust financial institutions and broad pool of investors, Hong Kong can play a vital role in incubating Macau’s financial market
Macau’s new Financial System Act, passed in 2023, demonstrates the government’s commitment to strengthening its financial system and keeping pace with the evolving financial technology. In particular, the act includes a specific section on financial technology, introducing a legal framework to grant temporary licences for financial technology projects on an experimental basis.
Although there is no stock exchange in Macau, the city has authorised two financial asset exchange platforms. In August 2018, the Macau government approved the establishment of Chongwa (Macao) Financial Asset Exchange (MOX). This is a debt securities trading platform which mainly serves Chinese firms and Chinese local government financial vehicles.
