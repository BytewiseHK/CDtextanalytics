Government hopes to rescue victims as soon as possible but there is no timeline in place, task force official says
But Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk Hau-yip, who is leading the group in Bangkok, said on Monday that any rescue operation would be difficult as most of the 12 Hong Kong victims were stranded at scam centres in Thai-Myanmar or Myanmar-Laos border areas.
“Today, we have had an eager response from the Thai government, and we feel that the Thai government strongly values this matter. Under their prime minister’s leadership, they have been enforcing relevant work in this aspect,” Cheuk said.
He said the Hong Kong government hoped to rescue the victims as soon as possible, but there was no timeline in place.
“Those areas are relatively chaotic and hard to control, any work to be carried out there will be difficult,” Cheuk said.
