New rules allowing greater oversight of works on government and military sites follow repeated warnings about spies targeting key facilities
China’s state security forces will be given fresh powers to supervise and manage sensitive construction work on sites such as key government buildings and military facilities.
A detailed set of rules, the first of their kind to be made public, were published on Wednesday and mark a further expansion of the powers of the Ministry of State Security – the country’s top spying and anti-espionage agency – and local state security forces.
The ministry has issued repeated warnings over the past 18 months that foreign spies have targeted key facilities amid escalating tensions between China and the United States.
The rules, consisting of 38 articles, will take effect on March 1 and cover all projects where security is a consideration, including buildings for key state bodies, the military and defence industry.
Any new construction projects, rebuilding works or alterations will need permission from state security agencies, who will also supervise and manage the works.
Those applying for security permits will need to submit detailed information about the function and ownership of the buildings in question along with design blueprints for the projects.
