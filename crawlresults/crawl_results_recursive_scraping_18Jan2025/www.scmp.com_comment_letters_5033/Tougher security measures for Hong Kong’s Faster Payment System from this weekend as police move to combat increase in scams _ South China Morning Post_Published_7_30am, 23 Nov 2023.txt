The suspicious proxy alert model will be used by the city’s 35 banks and nine stored-value facilities from Sunday and will trigger a warning when users enter the details of an account flagged as “high risk” by the police force’s Scameter search engine.
“We hope that when residents see this warning, they will stop transferring money to prevent themselves from being scammed and leading to them suffering a loss,” Chief Superintendent Kelly Cheng Lai-ki of the force’s cybersecurity and technology crime bureau said.
The system will send users a message that the FPS account they want to transfer money to is dangerous.
The Scameter contains information to help the public identify suspicious web addresses, phone numbers, emails, platform usernames or IP addresses.
