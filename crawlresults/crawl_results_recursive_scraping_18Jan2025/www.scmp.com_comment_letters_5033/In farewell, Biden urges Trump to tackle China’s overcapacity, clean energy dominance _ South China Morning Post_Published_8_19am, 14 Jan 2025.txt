In a departing message delivered a week before leaving office, Biden claimed the US is in a stronger position in a long-term competition with China
An earlier version of this report incorrectly cited Biden as saying that the Chinese economy "will never suppress" that of the US. The correct wording is "will never surpass".
US President Joe Biden urged his successor Donald Trump to tackle China’s “overcapacity” and dominance in clean energy supply chain, calling it a competition the US “must win”.
In a departing message delivered on Monday, a week before leaving office, Biden said the US is in a stronger position in a long-term competition with China, and claimed that the Chinese economy “will never surpass” that of the US owing to his efforts in making the country more competitive.
“When I took office, you all recall, and the experts believe … it was inevitable that China’s economy would surpass ours. But we in this room said, no, we make the investments in ourselves, we protect our workers and technology. That will not happen now,” Biden said at the US State Department.
He also claimed China has become “weaker” thanks to the US efforts with allies in countering Beijing in hi-tech, trade, and the Indo-Pacific during the four years of his tenure.
“It’s clear my administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play … We’re leaving them an America with more friends and strong reliance, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure.”
