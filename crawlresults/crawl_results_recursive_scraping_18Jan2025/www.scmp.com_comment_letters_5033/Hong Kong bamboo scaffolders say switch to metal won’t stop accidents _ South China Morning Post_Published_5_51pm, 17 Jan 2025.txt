Industry representatives issue warning days after 11 injured in bamboo scaffolding collapse at construction site in Kai Tak
Switching to metal scaffolding will not prevent construction accidents in Hong Kong, industry groups have said, adding that replacing a century-old bamboo craft will threaten 4,000 jobs.
The warning from bamboo scaffolding industry representatives on Friday followed the collapse of one of the structures at a construction site in Kai Tak that left 11 workers injured and resulted in an industrial accident victims group calling for a switch to metal alternatives.
The industry representatives also argued that a more effective solution would be strengthening safety checks throughout the construction process and enhancing workers’ knowledge.
“We noticed that the cause of most bamboo scaffolding incidents is the inappropriate arrangement during construction, followed by [risky alterations] to the structure,” said Ho Ping-tak, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union (Tung-king).
“It stems from issues with safety regulations on construction sites, rather than structural problems with bamboo scaffolding.”
Ho added that workers would build such scaffolding based on a project’s needs and an engineer’s drawings, ensuring it met safety requirements before the next phase in construction.
