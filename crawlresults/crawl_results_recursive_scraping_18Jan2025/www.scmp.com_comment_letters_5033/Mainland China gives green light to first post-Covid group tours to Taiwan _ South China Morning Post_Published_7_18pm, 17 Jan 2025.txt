Groups from Fujian and Shanghai are the first to be allowed to visit the island in a move Beijing says will help ‘strengthen exchanges’
The Culture and Tourism Ministry said preparations were “actively under way” – although there is no timetable for visits to resume – and the move would help normalise cross-strait exchanges, state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.
All outbound group trips from mainland China, including to Taiwan, were halted at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Beijing started allowing overseas group tours again in 2023 and since then travel has resumed to most destinations, including the United States and much of Europe.
In February last year, Taipei delayed a plan that could allow local agencies to organise tour groups to mainland China, citing the failure by Beijing to allow group tours to the island.
