Secretary for home and youth affairs defends teams in face of viral news clip in which officials duck requests for performance reports
Hong Kong’s home and youth affairs minister has defended the competency of the city’s community care teams amid doubts about their conduct, maintaining that all team members are unpaid volunteers and every penny of taxpayers’ money goes directly to community service.
Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak Mei-kuen also said on Friday that it was premature to report on the performance of the 452 care teams across the city’s 18 districts when they were only halfway through their two-year service.
But some of the teams’ conduct raised eyebrows after a viral video by the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s student publication, Ubeat, showed members’ callous or indifferent approach to their activities.
The video showed one team in Tuen Mun filling a youth seminar with elderly residents. Another in Tsuen Wan put team vests on non-members for a group photo during a visit to a national security-themed exhibition in Tsim Sha Tsui to create an impression of stronger participation.
Local councillors and officials also declined student reporters’ requests for records on the teams’ work and performance, with one saying only that “KPIs had been met”.
The home affairs secretary said after a community care team event on Friday that authorities would only publish their report at the end of the care teams’ two-year contracts so “comprehensive information” of what they had achieved could be included.
