One of the most appalling, distressing and unstomachable aspects of Hong Kong’s great “revolution of our times” has been the mob beatings on the streets.
Anyone foolhardy enough to openly express the slightest objection to what those of the militant persuasion among anti-government protesters may be doing, whether it’s throwing petrol bombs, causing traffic chaos or vandalising public property in the name of fighting for our freedoms, is instantly set upon and beaten into a bloody pulp.

Hong Kong’s Law Society reveals a member was assaulted and condemned the attackers
As in so many of these brazen attacks, in broad daylight and in full public view, the victim ended up on a hospital bed with severe injuries while the rabble who put him there got away scot free, there being no sign of police until it was all over.
I tried to reach out to Chan, a member of the Law Society, through a friend who knows him personally but was told that he would not talk to the media for fear of his family being targeted as well by those who nearly killed him to “liberate” Hong Kong.
So you not only get beaten comatose on this city’s streets for complaining about their fascist brand of democracy, you dare not open your mouth about it afterwards in case they mete out the same sort of vigilante justice to your loved ones as well.
