Rather than resolving conflicts outright, Beijing seeks to balance its diplomatic and strategic interests as a global power
On August 27, Li held a press conference to conclude his fourth round of shuttle diplomacy. His latest diplomatic mission, which took him to Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia between July 28 and August 7, coincided with Ukraine’s incursion into Russian territory.
During the press briefing, Li made a pointed but veiled critique of Western support for Ukraine. He expressed concern that the West’s lack of conditions for Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied weapons was exacerbating the conflict, and emphasised that recent developments on the battlefield confirmed these fears.
Li’s comments were a clear indication of Beijing’s stance, one that subtly shifts the blame onto Western powers while framing China as a responsible actor seeking to prevent further escalation.
