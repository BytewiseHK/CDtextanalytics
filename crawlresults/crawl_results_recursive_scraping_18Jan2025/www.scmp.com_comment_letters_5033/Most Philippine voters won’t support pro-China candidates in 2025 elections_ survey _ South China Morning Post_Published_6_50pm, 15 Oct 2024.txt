Such views are driven by concerns over the South China Sea dispute and pro-China candidates undermining national security, an analyst says
Only 5 per cent of those surveyed said they would support pro-China candidates, while 23 per cent were undecided, according to the survey conducted between September 6 and 13.
Dindo Manhit, president of Stratbase ADR Institute, which commissioned the Pulse Asia survey released on Monday, said the results reflected widespread scepticism towards candidates seen as too close to Beijing, driven by concerns over disputes in the South China Sea and fears that such ties could undermine national security.
“Electing pro-China candidates poses significant risks, as it will lead to policies that compromise our territorial integrity, [and] economic interests. Such candidates will become direct conduits for Chinese influence, which can jeopardise our national security and further empower a state that has repeatedly disregarded our sovereign rights and the international rules-based order,” Manhit said, according to a report by the Philippine News Agency.
More than 66 million registered Filipinos will cast their votes for over 18,280 candidates vying for posts across the country during midterm elections next May.
