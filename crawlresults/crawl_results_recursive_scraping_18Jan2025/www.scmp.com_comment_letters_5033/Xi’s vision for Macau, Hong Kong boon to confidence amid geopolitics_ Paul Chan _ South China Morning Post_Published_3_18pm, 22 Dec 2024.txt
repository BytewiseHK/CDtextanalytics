Hong Kong’s finance chief says president’s speech at inauguration of new Macau administration sums up ‘one country, two systems’
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s commitment to maintaining the “one country, two systems” governing principle for Hong Kong and Macau has boosted people’s confidence amid a complex geopolitical situation, the finance chief has said.
Chan said a good stable system must be maintained for a long time and it also embodied the values of peace, tolerance, openness and sharing.
“In the current complex geopolitical situation, the speech is more positive and makes people more confident,” he said in a weekly blog post on Sunday.
Summarising his vision for the long-term implementation of the governing principle, Xi said Hong Kong and Macau should work on four areas: exploit the advantages of the arrangement; prioritise national security while pushing for high-quality development; boost connectivity both internally and externally; and foster tolerance and harmony.
