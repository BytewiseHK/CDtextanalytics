As Malaysia prepares to assume the 2025 Asean chair, its trade minister argues for a unified approach to navigate the US-China rivalry
In 2025, Malaysia will again assume the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, population 676 million. While our region and the world have changed so much since Asean’s founding via the Bangkok Declaration of 1967, I would argue that Asean is more relevant than ever before.
Our region also plays a pivotal part in the global supply chain, with total trade in goods and services reaching US$3.5 trillion and US$1.083 trillion in 2023. Foreign direct investment inflows into Asean remained strong last year at US$229.8 billion.
Asean should thus talk itself up rather than down. We should recognise ourselves for what we are: a valued global partner with an attractive market base and a nascent middle-power broker, not only bringing the world together but also helping to secure our own economic prosperity.
