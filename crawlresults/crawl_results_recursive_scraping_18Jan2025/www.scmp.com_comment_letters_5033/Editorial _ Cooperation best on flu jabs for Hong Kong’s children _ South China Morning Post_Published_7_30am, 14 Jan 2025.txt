With peak influenza season nearing and cases on the rise in Hong Kong, it makes sense for the young and elderly to get vaccinated
Hong Kong has entered the influenza season – going by hospital admissions and positive laboratory tests for flu.
So soon after a pandemic this may not seem such a big event. But there is no room for complacency about measures that reduce the risk of serious illness, in particular vaccination.
Health authorities are on high alert for a severe flu season. Already outbreaks are increasing in schools and institutional settings such as care homes. The number of patients visiting accident and emergency clinics has surged.
Experts say peak flu season can be expected after Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, it is a race against time to lift the vaccination rate.
Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has stepped up pressure on schools that have not taken up a government offer of free flu vaccinations for students – 160-odd as of last week. Lo said they had an obligation to protect young children.
In a press release that criticised schools for inaction, the government published a list of those that had not opted in to the programme.
