Liaison office director Zheng Yanxiong calls for innovation, while Chief Executive John Lee vows bold steps
Beijing’s top envoy in Hong Kong has urged the city to broaden its links with the outside world to maintain its internationalisation, adding that it also needs to be more innovative to thrive in changing times, while the chief executive pledged to further boost the economy by taking bold steps.
Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong, also warned the city to stay “vigilant” and “alert” and not to overlook “the state of security” while seeking development, especially when the world was not at peace.
“We must remember that a weak state of security undermines economic development, and the reverse is also true,” Zheng said, addressing guests from the city’s political and business circles on Friday at a banquet hosted by his office to celebrate the coming Lunar New Year.
“It is equally crucial that we remain committed to both safeguarding national security and promoting economic growth.
“We must recognise that the world is not at peace, and Hong Kong cannot afford to be complacent. As global volatility increases, Hong Kong should be even more vigilant.”
Zheng called on the city government and all community members to “remain alert at all times” to protect the rule of law and “effectively manage public sentiment”.
