Blueprint will set the scene for the industry’s development for the next five years, government minister says
Hong Kong has rolled out a much-awaited tourism blueprint that highlights themes such as pandas, horse racing, mega-events and smart initiatives among updated strategies aimed at boosting the economy by HK$120 billion (US$15.5 billion) and employing 210,000 people in five years.
The document released on Monday lays out four development strategies, 16 implementation directions, 59 action plans and 133 measures to reinforce Hong Kong’s role as a hub for international and multi-destination tourism and as a city where East meets West.
Upon implementation, the tourism industry could generate HK$120 billion in economic value, the blueprint said, noting the sector accounted for 5 per cent of Hong Kong’s gross domestic product in 2018 and 2.6 per cent last year.
It said employment in the sector was expected to rise to about 210,000 in five years from 145,600 in 2023, a 44 per cent increase.
“Tourism was paralysed during the pandemic. Following the pandemic, tourists’ travel patterns have changed and we have to reform the industry,” Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui said on Monday.
“The blueprint will set the scene for the industry’s development for the next five years.”
