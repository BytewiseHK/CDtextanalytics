The Pentagon must make a decision about its F-22 Raptor programme and how to keep up with China, outgoing air force chief says
If it did press on, the US would need to add more than US$20 billion to the project’s budget just to cover research and development.
But he said another option to building an F-22 replacement was to create a F-35 successor that could manage uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft. The US could also put more reliance on long-range missile strikes, which was “relatively inexpensive”.
“But there are other priorities that we really need to fund first, so this decision ultimately depends upon [whether there] is enough money in the budget to buy all the other things we need, and is NGAD the right thing to buy,” he said.
Kendall – who will leave his post on Sunday after four years in the position – added that the air force might only be able to afford a small part of NGAD, even if they decided to go ahead with it.
