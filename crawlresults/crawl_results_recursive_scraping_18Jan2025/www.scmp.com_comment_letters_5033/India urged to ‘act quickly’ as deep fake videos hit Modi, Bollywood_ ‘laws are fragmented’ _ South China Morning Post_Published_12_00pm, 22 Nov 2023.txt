Modi, referring to a realistic fake video of himself performing a traditional Gujarati dance, expressed concern over the misuse of AI and deep fake content during a Diwali event on Saturday.
“There is a huge portion of India which does not have tools to verify or authenticate such content. This is developing into a big crisis. How will we stop this? It requires serious thought,” he told journalists at the event, which took place at the headquarters of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
