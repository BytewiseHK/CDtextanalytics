While Seoul’s own nuclear defence would lessen the US security burden, it would also undermine American interests in the Indo-Pacific region
One suggested benefit for the US is that a South Korean nuclear deterrent would relieve the US of direct involvement in potential conflicts with North Korea, lowering the risk of escalation with China and reducing America’s security burden.
However, that is why Washington will never want South Korea to develop its nuclear weapons. The US does not want to relieve South Korea and Japan of their security dependence on the American military.
