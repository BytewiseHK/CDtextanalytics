Boy, aged seven, rescued by firefighters and passers-by after his left foot became stuck in a gap in escalator at Park Central
A father has raised concerns over the safety of a Hong Kong shopping centre’s escalator after his seven-year-old son was injured when his foot got trapped in a gap in the moving staircase.
The boy’s left foot became stuck while his family was visiting Park Central in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday evening. Police were informed of the incident at 6.40pm by a shopper and a security guard but deemed the case as not requiring officer assistance.
The seven-year-old was rescued with the help of firefighters and passing shoppers before being taken to Tseung Kwan O Hospital for treatment.
The boy’s father said on Sunday that the family had come back to Hong Kong to visit relatives and were supposed to return to Canada next week for school. He said the pain his son had endured would be unforgettable.
“After a doctor’s examination and an X-ray scan, the appearance of his foot seems OK for now, with some superficial injuries. But internal injuries will require further detailed examination and observation in hospital,” the man wrote on social media.
The father thanked firefighters, paramedics, bystanders and an anonymous individual who injured their hand while trying to help.
