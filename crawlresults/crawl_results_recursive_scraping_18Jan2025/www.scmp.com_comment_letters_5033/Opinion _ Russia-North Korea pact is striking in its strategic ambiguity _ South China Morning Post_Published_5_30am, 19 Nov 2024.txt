The text of the treaty suggests the partnership will function more as a strategic hedge than a definitive bond
This treaty – which took five months to ratify on both sides following the initial announcement during Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June – aligns the two countries in mutual defence, marking a significant shift in Northeast Asian geopolitics.
Since the treaty was announced, Russia has moved cautiously, emphasising the partnership without echoing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s hyperbolic language.
While Kim lauded the relationship as an “invincible alliance”, Putin described it more temperately as having reached an “unprecedentedly high level”. This careful wording hints at Russia’s strategic ambivalence, balancing the alliance’s symbolic value against the potential risks of a formal defence commitment with North Korea.
