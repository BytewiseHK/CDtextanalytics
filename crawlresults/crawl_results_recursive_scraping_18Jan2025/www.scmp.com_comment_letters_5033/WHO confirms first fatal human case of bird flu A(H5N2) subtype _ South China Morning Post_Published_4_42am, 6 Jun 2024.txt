A person with prior health complications who had contracted bird flu died in Mexico in April and the source of exposure to the virus was unknown, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday.
WHO said the current risk of bird flu virus to the general population is low.
The 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico had been hospitalised in Mexico City and died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general discomfort, WHO said.
“Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,” WHO said in a statement.
It was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico, according to the WHO.
