Even if both sides know conflict would be damaging and distract from domestic concerns, early signals suggest a clash will be hard to avoid
US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping managed to keep tensions between their countries contained in 2024. But when president-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House this month, he will end this fragile stability, drive an unmanaged decoupling of the world’s most important geopolitical relationship and increase the risk of global economic disruption and crisis.
After all, Chinese leaders fear that a conciliatory approach will be perceived as accepting national humiliation, which would further stoke already rising public anger within China. If a more constructive approach towards the United States in 2024 only brought the return of “Tariff Man”, why stick to that path? Trump’s threats are merely the latest aggressive gesture by the US, confirming Chinese suspicions that American policymakers are intent on containing China’s emergence as a great power.
