Rocky Tuan also cites navigating the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the most unforgettable experiences during his tenure
Professor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi also said that one of the most unforgettable experiences during his seven years at the helm of the university was the “unprecedented challenges” created by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to remarks published in a university newsletter on Thursday.
He will step down as president and vice-chancellor on January 7, and leading molecular geneticist Professor Dennis Lo Yuk-ming will take over, serving a five-year term.
In an article published by CUHK on Thursday, Tuan noted that during his tenure, he had also served as the professor of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, taken part in research work and supervised six PhD students.
“After stepping down, I plan to continue these activities to stay updated on the latest developments in academia. I will also take an academic sabbatical to visit overseas institutions [and] explore new projects and ideas,” Tuan said when asked about his plans.
