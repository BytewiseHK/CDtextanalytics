The barrage came hours after Putin said he is willing to meet with US president-elect Trump, who has said he wants to end the war
Ukraine’s capital faced a Russian missile attack for the first time in almost a month, a day after Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin offered to hold talks with US president-elect Donald Trump.
The strikes targeting Kyiv killed one person and injured at least nine others, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Friday on his Telegram channel.
Buildings in four residential areas of the city as well as a warehouse and business centre were damaged by falling debris, Kyiv city’s military administration said.
Air defences downed all five ballistic missiles fired at Kyiv as well as 40 drones targeting other regions of the country, Ukraine’s Air Force command said on Telegram.
The Defence Ministry in Moscow said on Telegram that the attack was in retaliation for a Ukrainian strike in Russia’s Rostov region on Wednesday involving missiles supplied by Kyiv’s Western allies.
It claimed to have been targeting a design bureau involved in missile development, a Ukrainian security service command post and the positions of Patriot air-defence systems.
