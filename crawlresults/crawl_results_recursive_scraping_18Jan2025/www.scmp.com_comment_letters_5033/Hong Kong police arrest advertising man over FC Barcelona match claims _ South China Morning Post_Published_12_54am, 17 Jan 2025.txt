Boss arrested a week after Winman Advertising and Entertaining Group said it had intended to put on a match but was rejected by venue
The arrest of the man on Thursday came a week after organiser Winman Advertising and Entertaining Group issued a press release saying it had intended to put on a football match involving Barcelona in July at a new 50,000-seat stadium in Kai Tak Sports Park.
The announcement drew widespread media attention.
“Police do not rule out the possibility that some people may be wishful thinkers, believing they had the capability to facilitate international sporting events,” Chief Inspector Sun Yi-ki from the force’s cybersecurity and technology crime bureau.
“But due to a lack of experience and improper arrangements, these wishes did not materialise. Subsequently, they shifted the blame, misled the media … attempting to divert public attention.”
