Questions raised at US-China relations event about the power of an individual to make much difference to ties
Musk’s business ties with China and his close relationship with some senior Chinese officials led to early suggestions that he could be a “bridge” between the rival powers when Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
While some have suggested that Musk could have a positive impact on the US-China relationship, Wang Jisi, an influential academic and former adviser to the Chinese foreign ministry, said that his own American interactions indicated otherwise.
Speaking at the event on Sunday, Wang said Musk “has a lot of cooperation with China, knows the Chinese people, and has come to China many times”.
“Of course, I hope this is a good thing. After all, he is a businessman, a very skilled businessman, who has crossed over into politics. We cannot equate one person’s attitude towards China with the entire US policy,” he said at the event on US-China relations organised by Tsinghua University’s Institute of International Relations.
