It's no secret that booze was Hemingway's life-blood, for him and his fictional cohorts. 
			He was a sophisticated drinker, a lover of fine spirits, and a true connoisseur who sought 
			out the best bars from Paris to Pamplona. The Old Man honors Hemingway by taking inspiration
			from his novels, history, and folklore, and by using novel ingredients and culinary 
			accoutrements â€“ thereby paying tribute to the spirits and cocktails he loved.
