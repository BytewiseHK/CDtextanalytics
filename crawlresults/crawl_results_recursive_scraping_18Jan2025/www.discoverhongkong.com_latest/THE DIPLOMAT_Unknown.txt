Two dinner tasting menus are rooted in Chef Mario Peacke’s extensive knowledge and experience of German cuisine, accompanied by a wine list focused on a unique curation of German and Austrian labels. A nod to Chef Mario’s beloved pastime outside of the kitchen, the menus are named after common terms in photography.
