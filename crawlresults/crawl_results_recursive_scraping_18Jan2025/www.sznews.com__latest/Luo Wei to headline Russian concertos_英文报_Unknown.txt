THIS Friday evening, the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra (SZSO) will present a contemporary Chinese composition paired with two Russian masterpieces, featuring pianist Luo Wei as the soloist.Conducted by SZSO’s music director Lin Daye, the concert will commence with “Ode to Ancestors Yan and Huang,” a commissioned piece by the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. This work, inspired by Chinese legends, debuted in May 2018. Infusing folk melodies from China’s Northwest into a symphonic framework with Western orchestration, this movement emanates Chinese aesthetics and captivating grandeur. Portraying images of converging streams leading to a mighty river, the piece musically interprets the progression of Chinese civilization forged by the resilient Chinese people.Next on the program is Prokofiev’s “Piano Concerto No.3 in C Major, op.26,” the most frequently performed among his five piano concertos. Known for his signature style, Prokofiev blends brisk and rhythmic playing with flowing lyricism and sharp harmonies. Premiering in December 1921 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Frederick Stock, with Prokofiev himself as the soloist, the concerto initially faced mixed reactions until a pivotal 1922 rendition in Paris led by Serge Koussevitzky, cementing its status in the 20th-century canon.The program also includes Rachmaninoff’s “Piano Concerto No.2 in C Minor, op.18,” a fan-favorite that premiered in November 1901. This impassioned and powerful piece features themes that resonated throughout the 20th century, reappearing in various popular songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “Full Moon and Empty Arms” in 1945 and Eric Carmen’s “All by Myself” in 1975. It was made most famous when a portion of the second movement was set as the haunting motif of David Lean’s 1945 film “Brief Encounter.” By 2023, over 300 recordings of this work existed, including a rendition by Rachmaninoff himself, accompanied by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski in 1929.Luo stands out as one of the best pianists from a new generation. A graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, she trained with Gary Graffman and Robert McDonald. Over the past two years, Luo embarked on a 30-concert tour across China. Notably, she made her orchestral debut at the age of 11 with the Shanghai Philharmonic, presenting Prokofiev’s third piano concerto at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center — a piece she will now perform for the local audience.Time: 8 p.m., Jan. 17Tickets: 50-880 yuanVenue: Shenzhen Concert Hall, Futian DistrictMetro: Line 3 or 4 to Children’s Palace Station, Exit D(Li Dan)
