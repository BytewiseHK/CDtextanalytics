Catherine Newman, an English teacher from South Africa who moved to Shenzhen a year ago, has found the city to be the perfect backdrop for her lifelong passion — photography.
With her camera in hand and a knack for capturing details, Newman explores the vibrant mix of nature, architecture, and culture that defines this bustling city.
Becoming a photographer
Newman’s love for photography began in her childhood, inspired by her father, a photographer and artist. “From a young age, I accompanied him to beautiful locations, watching him work and learning to see the world through his eyes,” she recalls. This early exposure sparked a creative journey that grew to include making videos and capturing moments, passions she carried through school and university.

Shenzhen through her eyes
Now living in Shenzhen, Newman spends her free time exploring the city with her camera. Her photos reflect a deep appreciation for the diversity and energy of her surroundings.
For Newman, Shenzhen stands out among the cities she’s lived in across Asia. “Coming from South Africa, I missed being surrounded by nature,” she said. “I think that’s why Shenzhen is my favorite. I can go to places like Qianhai Stone Park, where I can see the ocean, the trees, and hear birds. At the same time, I can enjoy beautiful architecture and the bustling city life. There’s so much happening around the city. I can capture different cultures, nature, and architecture — there’s just so much to work with here.”

Some of her favorite spots include Qianhai Stone Park, where sleek modern architecture meets tranquil natural beauty, and Tanglang Mountain, a go-to spot for nature photography. She’s also drawn to Sea World, a lively cultural hub with unique architecture, and Yantian’s coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a constant source of inspiration.
For Newman, photography is more than a creative outlet — it’s a way to tell stories and share her experiences. “When I travel, I capture whatever mesmerizes me — whether it’s the scenery, the people, or the activities. It’s my way of showing others the beauty I encounter,” she said.
Shenzhen has become an endless source of inspiration for Newman. The city’s unique blend of modernity and nature, coupled with its cultural richness, offers countless opportunities for creative exploration. Whether she’s photographing a vibrant market or a peaceful park, Catherine’s images capture the soul of Shenzhen — a city where tradition meets innovation and urban life coexists with natural beauty.
Taking photos of streets, people
In Shenzhen, Newman has embraced street photography, capturing the unfiltered moments of city life. “Street photography is challenging but incredibly rewarding,” she explained. “It requires respect for people’s privacy and the ability to work with the natural flow of busy environments,” she added. Despite these challenges, she thrives on the energy of Shenzhen’s streets and prefers using natural light to create her shots.

Newman’s skills extend beyond landscapes to portraits. “I’m getting more into portrait photography now. At first, it can feel a bit awkward for people, so I try to help them relax and just have fun, as if the camera isn’t there. The best photos often come when people are being themselves and enjoying the moment,” she said.

For aspiring photographers, Newman offers this advice: “Explore your surroundings with curiosity and respect. Find what speaks to you, and let your photos tell a story.”
