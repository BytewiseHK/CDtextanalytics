If you have a partner, gotten married, and are now a parent, remember this: Do not replicate your father’s behavior. It leads to nothing positive.Refrain from physical discipline towards your child, and do not bring your negative emotions home, causing your children to feel anxious and on edge.Each phase of life presents unique challenges that may provoke feelings of anger, despair, or sensitivity.Thus, address your emotions in a rational manner rather than venting them without reason.Perhaps I have rambled on for too long. I will cherish this moment if you turn out fine.

Dear grown-up me:
I hope when you read this letter, you’re 38 years old. Well, let’s get down to business. It’s Dec. 28, 2024, the third day after Christmas.
If this letter arrives at an incorrect time, it must be due to a mistake by the courier, as I specifically requested it to be delivered at this particular date. The reason I’m writing this letter is that I hope to capture the thoughts I had as a teenager.
My father is an irritable person. He often gets upset about trivial matters. Sometimes his reactions are justifiable, but other times, they seem baseless. On one particular day, I made a decision: to leave negativity in the past.
I questioned my mom about why my father was so irritable and frequently left us in a bad mood.
She explained that my grandfather didn’t know how to raise children properly; he only knew how to discipline through punishment and scolding.
This upbringing led to my father’s perpetual bad mood and his tendency to take it out on us.
I am unsure, 38-year-old me, if you still recall this memory, or if your mind has suppressed it due to its unpleasant nature. They say time alters everything, and I concur. There exists a notable distinction between my current self and the person I was a decade ago.
I have noticed a growing impatience within me, and I fear that I may follow in my father’s footsteps, becoming an irritable person myself.
Therefore, I implore you to contemplate your actions before you act, particularly if they may inflict pain upon those who care for you. If you have a partner, gotten married, and are now a parent, remember this: Do not replicate your father’s behavior. It leads to nothing positive.
Refrain from physical discipline towards your child, and do not bring your negative emotions home, causing your children to feel anxious and on edge.
Each phase of life presents unique challenges that may provoke feelings of anger, despair, or sensitivity.
Thus, address your emotions in a rational manner rather than venting them without reason.
Perhaps I have rambled on for too long. I will cherish this moment if you turn out fine.
