After the in-person visits and interviews of local and provincial delegates to the Two Sessions in Guangdong Province earlier before the conferences, John Milligan-Whyte, the Chairman of the America-China Partnership Foundation detailed his thoughts on the system of two sessions in China.
As the first part of China to economically develop, Guangdong has been ranking first in the country for 36 consecutive years. Hearing main targets in the Guangdong Government Work Report, Whyte was optimistic for provincial economic goals being achieved in the year of 2025.
