China Southern Airlines and Air Serbia, the flag carriers of China and Serbia respectively, have recently signed a codeshare agreement covering trunk routes between Guangzhou and Belgrade, and Shanghai Pudong and Belgrade, as well as Air Serbia's European network.
China Southern passengers can now connect to 21 European destinations, including Berlin, Milan, Zurich, and Bologna, while Air Serbia passengers gain access to seven domestic Chinese destinations, such as Shanghai, Dalian, Harbin, and Chongqing, and 13 international cities, including Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Bangkok, Hanoi, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur.
This deal follows China Southern's launch of direct flights between Guangzhou and Belgrade in September 2024 and is part of an ongoing partnership under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two airlines. The collaboration aims to strengthen aviation ties and promote the development of the Air Silk Road between the two countries.
