Recently, residents in Wanjiang and Hongmei have noticed Robotaxi vehicles frequently testing on local roads, signaling that autonomous taxis may soon be available for public use. Robotaxi, Baidu's driverless ride-hailing service, has entered the city's trial phase.
Passengers who tried the service praised the Apollo RT6's spacious interiors, featuring voice controls and premium amenities like heated, ventilated, and massaging seats. These high-tech vehicles strictly adhere to speed limits, offering a smooth and safe journey. Despite the buzz, Robotaxi customer support clarified that the service is still in its preparatory phase. However, users of the app in select areas like Wanjiang and Hongmei have already been able to book rides, indicating the service's imminent rollout.
