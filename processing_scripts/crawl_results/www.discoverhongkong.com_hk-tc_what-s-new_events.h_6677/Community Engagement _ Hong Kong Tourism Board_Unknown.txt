The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) aims not only to attract visitors to the city but also to strengthen the community’s bond with the tourism industry through a range of exciting and stimulating engagement programmes. We hope that by participating in HKTB activities, people across the community will share our passion to maintain Hong Kong’s reputation as a world-class destination and drive the sustainable development of the tourism industry.
