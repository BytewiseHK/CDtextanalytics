Mostly Harmless is a Farm to Glass cocktail bar.
We make drinks based on what inspires us, using locally sourced ingredients.
The real concept is taking care of people, the excuse is the drinks.
The quest to make an incredible drink is all about intention. What we see in the drink is a product of where all its ingredients come from.
Everything we make is done with simplicity to honour the ingredients we use.
A good time, a good drink, and everything that comes with it.
We welcome walk-ins and currently do not take reservations.
Opening Hours
Tuesday to Sunday
5pm - 12am
