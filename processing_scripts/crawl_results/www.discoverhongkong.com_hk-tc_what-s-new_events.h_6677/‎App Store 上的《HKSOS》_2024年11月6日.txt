Especially when you are worried, scared, and in the middle of nowhere, this program can be found in the shortest possible time, why don't you install it? This program can be found in the shortest time, why don't you install it? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻Trence
it is a very useful app, no other app can replace it as it connects to 999 centre that other hiking apps cannot.  It would be great if the route planning function can be enhanced.On the other hand, distance post and other hiking features should be added to the map.  Also, if social media sharing function is avialble then it helps alot.If the photos taken during the journey can be shown at the end in the summary that will be perfect!Thanks HKSOS.
