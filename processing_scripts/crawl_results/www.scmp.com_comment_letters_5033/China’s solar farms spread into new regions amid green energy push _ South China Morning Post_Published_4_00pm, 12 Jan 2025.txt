Country’s largest mudflat solar photovoltaic energy storage facility combines salt production with photovoltaic power generation
China is installing innovative solar power projects across landscapes ranging from coastal mudflats to western deserts as part of efforts to achieve its green development goals.
On Tuesday, China’s largest mudflat solar photovoltaic energy storage facility began operations in the eastern province of Shandong, transforming 1,200 hectares (2,965 acres) of saline-alkali land into a “new oasis” for clean energy.
Coastal mudflats, with their abundant sunlight and minimal obstructions, provide an ideal setting for solar installations. The area receives over 2,600 hours of sunlight a year, averaging more than seven hours a day, China Central Television reported.
The project, which integrates salt production with photovoltaic power generation, is expected to generate enough electricity to power around 500,000 households a year, deputy chief engineer Wang Yang told CCTV.
Wang Xueli, director of the Huadian Laizhou Power Station said the “double-glass, bifacial solar panels reflect sunlight from the salt surfaces, boosting power output by about 3 per cent”.
“The heat generated by the panels raises the brine temperature by around 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which enhances salt production,” Wang added.
