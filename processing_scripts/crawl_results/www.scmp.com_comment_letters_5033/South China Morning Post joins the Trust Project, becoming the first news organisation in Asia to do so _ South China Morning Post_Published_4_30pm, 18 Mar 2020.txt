To our readers,
The Trust Project is a worldwide initiative that provides standards of news production to help readers identify credible journalism. Today, we join 32 other well-respected news sites that believe in the importance of holding ourselves to high standards and combating misinformation and fake news.
To our editorial team, it means that we now join a consortium of the world’s top media companies that includes the BBC,The Washington PostandThe Economist. As a global network of world-class news outlets, we are all working towards the same goal to affirm and amplify journalism’s commitment to transparency, accuracy and inclusion.
The initiative is also supported by tech platforms such as Google, Facebook and Bing, who use the Trust Indicators to guide how they carry quality journalism.
Qualifying for the Trust Project meant having our newsroom undergo a rigorous process of checks and balances. Essentially, it was an exercise in making the journalistic ethics that we knew as a company transparent to readers. That meant being consistent across the company and being aligned to a global standard.
