Children’s Rights Association gives score of 26 out of 100, naming housing as its biggest concern, followed by medical services and education for 2025
The Children’s Rights Association on Wednesday released the report for 2024 evaluating authorities’ performance in legislation, policies and services targeting poor children and their families.
While 26 is below the pass mark of 50, the latest score was the highest since the group started releasing its annual review in 2005. The association gave a score of 21 in 2023 and 19 in 2022.
The rating was decided by more than 20 children ambassadors, aged 17 and under, and after consulting about 5,000 other members, all minors, through its app and various meetings.
“The government has not made much progress on its policies addressing social challenges such as poverty, the wealth gap, medical care and welfare,” said Lau Yui, one of the ambassadors.
The 11-year-old Primary Six pupil said the average waiting time for public housing remained long and little policy progress had been made in areas such as healthcare, poverty alleviation or legislation banning discrimination against new arrivals from mainland China.
“The current government focused on economic recovery but neglected to comprehensively tackle the problem of child poverty through policies, legislation or services,” he added. “Its work progressed slowly and could not keep up with social needs.”
