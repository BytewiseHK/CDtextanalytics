In nomination hearing, Rubio also slams Beijing’s ‘violation’ of Hong Kong’s autonomy and asserts ‘national defence’ component of Taiwan Relations Act
Florida’s Senator Marco Rubio, nominated by president-elect Donald Trump as Secretary of State, sharply criticised China’s global ambitions during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, singling out Beijing’s involvement in the Panama Canal as a significant threat to US national security.
The canal handles as much as 5 per cent of global trade and is vital to America’s regional military operations and economic interests.
“I’m compelled to respect that an argument could be made that the terms under which that canal were turned over have been violated, because, while technically, sovereignty over the canal has not been turned over to a foreign power, in reality, a foreign power possesses it through their company companies,” Rubio said
“If [China] orders a company to shut it down or impede our transit, they will have to do so,” he added.
