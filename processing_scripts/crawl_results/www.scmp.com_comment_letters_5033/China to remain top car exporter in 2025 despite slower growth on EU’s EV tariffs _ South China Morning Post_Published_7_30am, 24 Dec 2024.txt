China’s top auto firms are likely to diversify by introducing petrol cars and hybrid models to blunt the impact of trade barriers
According to estimates from Hua Chuang Securities, overseas shipments of cars assembled on the mainland could exceed 5.58 million units in 2025, up 14 per cent from a year earlier. That is slower than the projected 29 per cent gain this year and 58 per cent rise in 2023, it said, when China overtook Japan as the world’s largest car exporter.
In the first three quarters of this year, mainland-based carmakers reported a 27 per cent growth in exports, reaching 3.1 million units, according to research firm Canalys.
“Europe remains a core market for Chinese carmakers’ globalisation efforts,” he said. “SAIC Motor is a clear example – it introduced hybrid versions of its MG3 and MG ZS models, aiming to challenge Japanese brands’ position in Europe.”
