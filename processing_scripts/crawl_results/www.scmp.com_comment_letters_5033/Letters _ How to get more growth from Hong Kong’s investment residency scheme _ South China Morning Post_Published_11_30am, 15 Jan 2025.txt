Currently, CIES applicants must make a minimum investment of HK$30 million (US$3.85 million), including HK$3 million in HKIC’s venture capital portfolio.
However, drawing from my experience in Hong Kong’s financial markets, I believe we can better balance domestic growth with our wealth management aspirations.
Specifically, I propose mandatory allocations beginning with 20 per cent, or HK$6 million, in HKIC’s portfolio – double the current requirement – supporting strategic growth sectors, and 30 per cent, or HK$9 million, in Hong Kong-incorporated, Securities and Futures Commission-authorised funds (i.e. local funds) focusing on small and mid-cap stocks listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
For the remaining 50 per cent, or HK$15 million, applicants could choose between two routes. The traditional investment route would include 33.3 per cent or HK$10 million in local funds or managed accounts investing primarily in Hong Kong equity and debt securities and/or Hong Kong property, and 16.7 per cent or HK$5 million in unrestricted SFC-authorised funds or managed accounts. The direct contribution route would include a fixed donation of HK$10 million to the likes of the government’s Lotteries Fund, the Community Care Fund, the Hospital Authority budget and the budget for the Hospital Development Plans.
