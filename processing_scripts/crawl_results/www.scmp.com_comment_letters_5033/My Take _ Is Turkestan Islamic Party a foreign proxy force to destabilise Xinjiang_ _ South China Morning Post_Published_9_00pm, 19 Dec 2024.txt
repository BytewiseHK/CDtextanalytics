A video by the militant group against ‘Chinese infidels’ has been spread widely by mainstream news media, while similar propaganda by Hamas and Hezbollah are routinely suppressed or ignored
Now we know why the Western media and politicians have been so keen to connect China with Syria under the deposed Bashar al-Assad, even though Beijing has tried to be friendly with everyone in the Middle East, autocratic and democratic alike, including, until very recently, Israel. Hush, don’t say Gaza and genocide, please!
Suddenly, the Western media are heavily reporting on the hitherto obscure Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP) as Uygur militants fighting for independence and freedom for Xinjiang.
The militant group has vowed to take the fight to China, in a video released last week, showing its well-armed and disciplined fighters in impressive military fatigues. Quite a distance there, though, from the Near East to the Far East, to borrow from some old geographical phrases of Western imperialists.
Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamic “terrorist” groups have routinely produced such propaganda videos against Israel and the West, and they are almost always suppressed or ignored in the mainstream news media.
Beijing has long linked the TIP to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which has been classified as terrorist.
A more than four-minute documentary-like clip by The Telegraph was practically promoting the TIP while repeating all the Western anti-China tropes as if to justify the group’s promised terrorism against Chinese. It was viewed more than 1.9 million times as of yesterday.
