Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai’s2046andMy Blueberry Nightsaren’t his best films, but they do add something to his oeuvre. We consider two of the director’s less favoured movies.
For Wong,2046isn’t a sequel; the filmmaker notes that the narrative and style of the two films – the later one has science-fiction elements – are significantly different.
“I don’t think of it as a sequel, as sequels tell of ongoing events – they continue the story,” Wong said in a documentary on the making of the film. “To me,2046is an echo ofIn the Mood for Love– it’s a different story.
“It’s about how a person faces his future given all the things that have happened to him in the past.
