To avoid reducing its appeal for wealthy families, Hong Kong will need to look at ways other than higher taxes to trim budget shortfalls, Bonds Group says
Hong Kong should maintain its low tax regime, preserve its currency peg to the US dollar and embrace the trading of digital assets to attract more capital from global family offices, some investors said.
“Hong Kong is an attractive location for family offices because of its low tax jurisdiction,” said Anson Chan, chairman and CEO of his family-owned real estate company Bonds Group of Companies. “The city has low profit tax rates, while it has no inheritance tax.”
To keep that advantage, Chan said Hong Kong’s government will have to look options other than higher taxes to fill its coffers and reduce its budget deficit, he said at the Asian Financial Forum on Tuesday. This will depend on Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po’s initiatives to balance the budget or avoid dipping too much into its reserves.

How can Hong Kong save itself from its nearly HK$100 billion deficit?
The government announced tax breaks in May 2023, including a cash-for-residency programme, to entice wealthy business owners. Family offices seek investment gains, plan succession and pursue philanthropy. Hong Kong had more than 2,700 single-family offices last year, according to a report published by Deloitte.
