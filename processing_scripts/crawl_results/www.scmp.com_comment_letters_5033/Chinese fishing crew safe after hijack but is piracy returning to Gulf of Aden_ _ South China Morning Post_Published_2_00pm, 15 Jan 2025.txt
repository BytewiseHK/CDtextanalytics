Attacks remain well below 2011 peak but China’s vast maritime interests in the waters off Somalia could be targeted, observers say
Those concerns were once again at the fore on Monday, when China announced through its embassy in Mogadishu that the boat and its crew had finally been released after the unremitting efforts of the Chinese government.
According to the embassy, the vessel was placed under the illegal control of an armed group in the waters off the coast of Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in Somalia’s northeast, and taken to its Xaafuun district.
The embassy strongly condemned the “vicious action which threatened the safety of the crew and international navigation security”.
It did not say whether money was paid to the group, which initially demanded US$10 million in ransom and was reported to have turned down offers of US$300,000 and US$1 million.
Paul Nantulya, a China specialist at the National Defence University’s Africa Centre for Strategic Studies in Washington, said that if a ransom was paid to release the vessel it would not have been out of the ordinary.
