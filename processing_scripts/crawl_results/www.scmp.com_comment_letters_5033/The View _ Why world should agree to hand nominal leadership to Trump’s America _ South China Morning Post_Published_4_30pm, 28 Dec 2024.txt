The US simply cannot afford to sustain its dominance so there’s no real danger, but pandering to Trump’s vanity could have its rewards
A US-enforced global order is not where the world is at now.Primus inter pares, or first among equals, it may be, but only in the context of an order which respects the legitimacy of other ideologies to arrive at a viable form ofmodus vivendi, or living together.
Why should other G7 or G20 leaders accept the idea of existing under even the nominal leadership of the United States when their own countries and cultures date back much further than that of a former British colony?
