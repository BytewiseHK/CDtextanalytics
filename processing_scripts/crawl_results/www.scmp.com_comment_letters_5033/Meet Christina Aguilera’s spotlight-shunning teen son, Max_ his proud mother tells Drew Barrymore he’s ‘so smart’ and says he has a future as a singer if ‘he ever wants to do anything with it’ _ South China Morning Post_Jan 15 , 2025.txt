Although he rarely makes appearances on social media, 17-year-old Max has accompanied the ‘Dirrty’ singer to the premieres of The Emoji Movie and The Addams Family
In an interview with People in 2019, the singer spoke about her children being her priority and how, despite her jam-packed schedule, “the key is truly making sure that they always feel safe and always feel connected”. Throughout the years, the 44-year-old has managed to maintain a solid co-parenting relationship with ex-husband Jordan Bratman. “We make blended families work,” Christina shared in a now-deleted Instagram post, as reported by Today.
Curious about what her son Max is up to now? Here’s everything we know.
Aguilera exchanged vows with Jordan Bratman in November 2005 in a ceremony held in California’s Napa Valley, reported People. She welcomed her first child, Max Liron Bratman, on January 12, 2008.
Though the pair called it quits in 2010 when Max was just two, they’ve kept things amicable for their son. “Although Jordan and I are separated, our commitment to our son Max remains as strong as ever,” Aguilera shared in a statement at the time, per Billboard.
Reflecting on the decision to end her five-year marriage, the pop star told People in 2010 that the relationship had become “unhealthy and unhappy” for her and Bratman. “I really didn’t want to hurt Jordan and I felt torn about splitting our marriage up,” she shared.
