The former Louisiana State University wide receiver turned himself into the authorities on Sunday night, and was jailed before being released on bail on US$151,000, according to police records. A news release from the Louisiana State Police alleged that Lacy had been driving a 2023 Dodge Charger on Louisiana Highway 20 and “recklessly passed multiple vehicles at a high rate of speed by crossing the centreline and entering the northbound lane while in a designated no-passing zone.” After colliding “head-on with a southbound 2017 Kia Sorento”, police allege that Lacy did not stop, but left the scene “without stopping to render aid, call emergency services, or report his involvement in the crash”.
