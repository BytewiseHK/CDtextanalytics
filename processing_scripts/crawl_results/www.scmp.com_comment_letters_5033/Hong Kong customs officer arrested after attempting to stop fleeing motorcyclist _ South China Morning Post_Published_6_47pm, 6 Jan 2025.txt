Incident that killed the rider has sparked heated debate over whether the off-duty officer’s actions were appropriate
A Hong Kong customs officer has been arrested on suspicion of tampering with a vehicle after he tried to stop a motorcycle apparently fleeing from police, narrowly missing the rider who later crashed and died.
The officer, 40, was arrested on suspicion of breaching the Road Traffic Ordinance after the incident took place on Friday, with the incident caught on dashcam footage that sparked a heated discussion.
A police spokesman said on Monday that the man had been released on bail, with the force to seek advice from the Department of Justice.
Under the ordinance, if a person, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, gets into a vehicle or tampers with any part of it, the individual commits an offence and is liable to a fine of HK$5,000 (US$640), and imprisonment for up to 12 months.
Dashcam footage of the incident on Friday shows the off-duty officer standing in the middle of the road, preparing to intercept the motorbike as it heads towards him at high speed.
In the clip, the officer’s right hand is briefly seen connecting with the motorcyclist as the bike speeds past him.
The crash took place at 5.46pm as the motorcycle ridden by a 27-year-old man surnamed Wong was travelling along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street in Kowloon Bay, according to police.
