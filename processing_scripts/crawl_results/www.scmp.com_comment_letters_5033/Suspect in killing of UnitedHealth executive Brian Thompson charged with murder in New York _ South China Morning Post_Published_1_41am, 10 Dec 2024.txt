Suspect Luigi Mangione, 26, arrested in Pennsylvania with ‘ghost gun’ and silencer after he was spotted eating at a McDonald’s
New York prosecutors filed a murder charge against the suspect in the killing of a UnitedHealth executive, a brazen shooting that set off a manhunt that culminated in his capture in Pennsylvania earlier on Monday.
The action brought an end to a tense five-day manhunt for the suspected killer.
When approached by two police officers inside the McDonald’s and asked if he had recently been in New York, Mangione began to shake and went quiet, one of the responding officers said at a press conference. He had been wearing a mask and sitting alone with a laptop and backpack.
A search of the backpack at the police station turned up a black “ghost gun” – a firearm assembled from parts, making it untraceable – loaded with a magazine and a silencer. Pennsylvania authorities said the weapon, as well as clothing and a mask, were similar to those used by the killer.
