From hit film The Last Dance to stage shows, Hong Kong writers use Chinese funerals to find meaning and help audiences cope with death
Death remains a taboo topic in Chinese culture because of its association with bad luck. But over the past few weeks, a Hong Kong film about the funeral business has taken the city box office by storm.
It also broke Hong Kong’s single-day box office record and other major Hong Kong movie records.
Rather, it is about humans’ innate need for ritual, in whatever shape or form, to help process loss.
“I have some family members who passed away a few years ago during the [Covid-19] pandemic. In preparation for their funerals, I came across the ‘breaking hell’s gate’ ritual, which got me thinking,” says Anselm Chan Mou-yin, writer and director ofThe Last Dance.
