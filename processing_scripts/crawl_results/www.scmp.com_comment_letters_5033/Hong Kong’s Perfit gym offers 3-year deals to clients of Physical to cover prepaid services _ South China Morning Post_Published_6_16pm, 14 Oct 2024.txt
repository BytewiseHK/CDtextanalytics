Customers who accept deal can use services already paid for under now-defunct Physical chain
A new investor in the now-defunct Physical gym chain in Hong Kong has offered affected members contracts that will allow them to use services at two recently reopened sites for up to three years without charge.
Perfit, which has recently taken over two locations previously operated by Physical in Wan Chai and Mong Kok, said on Monday it would allow customers of the closed chain to continue to use the reopened gyms, but clients would need to agree to new terms and conditions.
The move cleared up some of the uncertainty faced by the chain’s former customers following its abrupt closure in September.
But the offer only covers already-paid services for a maximum of three years, leaving those on longer Physical contracts with only a partial solution.
Perfit reopened Physical’s Wan Chai branch on October 4 and its Mong Kok outlet on October 10.
Perfit is affiliated with Perface, which offered affected Physical customers the chance to transfer their unused beauty packages last week. The Consumer Council revealed on Monday night that there was no cap on the service period in the offer.
