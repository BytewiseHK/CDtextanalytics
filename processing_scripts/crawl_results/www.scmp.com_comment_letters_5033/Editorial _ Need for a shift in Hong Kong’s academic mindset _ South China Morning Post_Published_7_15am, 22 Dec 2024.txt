High expectations, a heavy workload and stress can have a serious impact on the mental health of students. A more balanced approach is needed
The ambition of Hong Kong parents for their children to excel academically is matched by an education system notorious for its emphasis on achieving results. This single-minded drive for high grades produces an impressive haul of straight A students and propels many young people on the path to successful careers.
But it has long been recognised that high expectations, a heavy workload and soaring stress levels can have a serious impact on the mental health of students. The need for a more balanced approach remains.
A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Christian Service between June and September revealed almost half of the 597 people aged 15-24 interviewed regarded themselves as failures.
The results are, in themselves, depressing. More than three-quarters of respondents said their biggest failures concerned academic performance.
The survey’s findings coincided with a report by Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong revealing that 10 children committed suicide at the start of the new school year, more than at the same time last year.
This follows the number of suicides among children aged 15 and under reaching a 10-year high in 2023. It is a disturbing trend.
