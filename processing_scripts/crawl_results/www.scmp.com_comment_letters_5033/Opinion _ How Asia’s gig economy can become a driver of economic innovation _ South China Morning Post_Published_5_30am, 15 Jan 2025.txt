The gig economy has the potential to transform lives across Asia, but only if regulators, insurers and platforms rise to the moment
Foreign platforms face delays and obstacles in identifying suitable partners, which can derail investment. Bureaucratic hurdles also create uncertainty and discourage innovation. As neighbouring countries modernise investor-friendly policies, Nepal risks falling behind.
To remain competitive, Nepal must adopt regulatory reforms that are more in line with the needs of global investors. Policies promoting collaboration between international platforms and local businesses could stimulate economic growth and technological advancement.
Tax policies across Asia can be burdensome for gig workers. In India, drivers must pay both goods and services tax and income tax on their earnings, effectively double-taxing their already modest incomes. In some Southeast Asian countries, workers are taxed on gross earnings, ignoring essential costs such as fuel, maintenance and insurance. This erodes take-home pay and can push some drivers out of the industry altogether.
