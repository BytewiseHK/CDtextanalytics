The worsening problem of ‘involution’, or neijuan, is forcing Beijing to ramp up rhetoric to overcome a major obstacle to China’s economic growth
China should take action to abate low-quality vicious competition resulting inneijuan,or “involution”, and encourage high-quality development, a senior economic official said in an article published by the official newspaper of the Communist Party.
“Intensified involutionary competition in certain industries has driven down product prices, reducing profitability and putting some sectors in distress,” wrote Han Wenxiu, deputy director of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission’s general office, in a piece published by People’s Daily on Tuesday.
“Involutionary competition” refers to cutthroat competition wherein a rise in resource investment fails to generate proportional returns or support reinvestment in research and development.
It has been one of the major obstacles in China’s economy, as such intense internal competition is now prevalent in several sectors.
Echoing Han’s comments, Li Shufu, the founder and chairman of Geely, one of the major automobile manufacturers in China, pledged to “firmly oppose the vicious involutionary competition” in his year-end speech on Tuesday.
