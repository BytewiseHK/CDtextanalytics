The deal between Huawei and Fangda comes as the Shenzhen-based technology giant is deepening its footprint in traditional industries
Chinese telecommunications gear giant Huawei Technologies will work with the steel and aviation industries to drive the use of digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies through a deal with industrial conglomerate Fangda Group Industrial.
Huawei signed strategic partnership deals on Friday with Hainan Airlines Holding and Fangda Special Steel Technology, both owned by Fangda Group. The collaboration focuses on smart transformation, trial applications of AI large language models (LLM), the low-altitude economy and other areas, according to a statement issued by the conglomerate, whose business interests also cover the carbon, healthcare and commerce sectors.
The deal between Huawei and Fangda comes as the Shenzhen-based technology giant is deepening its footprint in traditional industries to empower China’s conventional businesses with its AI and communication technologies.
Fangda chairman Fang Wei said the company hoped to further expand its collaboration with Huawei into its pharmaceutical business, based on the “long-term and in-depth cooperation” in aviation and steel, according to the statement published on Sunday.
While the aviation and steel segments under Fangda are very different industries, they both have the foundational need to develop AI and big data technologies, Huawei’s cloud chief Zhang Pingan was quoted as saying in the statement.
