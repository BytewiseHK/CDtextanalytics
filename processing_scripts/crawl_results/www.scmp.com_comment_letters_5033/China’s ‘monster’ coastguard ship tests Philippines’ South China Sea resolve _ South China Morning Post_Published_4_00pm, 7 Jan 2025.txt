Observers interpret the presence of the 165-metre vessel near Scarborough Shoal as a warning to Manila about its military ties with the US
Using Canada’s advanced detection technology, the Philippine coastguard tracked the Chinese vessel as it manoeuvred through the West Philippine Sea, a term Manila uses for the parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In a video posted by the Philippine coastguard, BRP Cabra, a Philippine patrol vessel, radioed the Chinese ship to demand that it leave Philippine waters.
“CCG 5901. This is BRP Cabra, MMRV 4409. We are reminding you that you are within 72.6 nautical miles west by the south of Silanguin, Zambales in the Philippine exclusive economic zone. Please leave this area immediately. Over,” the Philippine crew said, referring to the bow numbers of the two vessels.
As of Monday evening, the Philippine coastguard reported that the Chinese vessel remained in the area and was last spotted 148km (80 nautical miles) from Lubang Island in Occidental Mindoro. Coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela accused the vessel of carrying out “erratic movements” inconsistent with innocent passage.
The Chinese coastguard replied to the radio call and said: “The so-called award for the South China Sea arbitration is illegal and invalid. China neither accepts it nor recognises it,” referring to the 2016 international tribunal ruling that invalidated Beijing’s claims in the region.
