Consumer Council tests 18 models and finds some failed to keep drinks warm, with hot water cooling nearly 70 degrees Celsius in six hours
Some travel mugs tested by Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog failed to keep drinks warm, with hot water cooling by nearly 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) in just six hours.
The Consumer Council tested 18 models of travel mugs available in the city, according to its monthly report released on Wednesday, and found that their thermal insulation efficacy varied significantly.
The watchdog tested the mugs by adding water no cooler than 95 degrees into the vessels and leaving the liquid inside for six hours. Within that time, it found that the contents of three plastic models dipped nearly 70 degrees to about room temperature.
Water in an Oolab mug dropped to 29 degrees, fell to 27 degrees in the Ricocafe one, and to 26.3 degrees in the Elephant Cuppa.
Two stainless steel models – the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler and the NOC x MiiR Flip Traveler Tumbler – were both able to maintain water temperatures of above 60 degrees.
The remaining 13 models maintained water temperatures of between 41.7 and 60 degrees.
