It marks a paradigm shift in Beijing’s governance style for Hong Kong, underscoring the need to expand a political talent pool beyond the traditional bureaucrats and technocrats.
With security minister John Lee Ka-chiu becoming chief secretary and police commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung succeeding Lee, some pundits see it as the end of the decades-long “AO era”, the initials referring to the powerful and skilled administrative officers who have dominated the government until now.
It is more of a reflection of Beijing’s disappointment in the system, and its determination to push for a transformation of civil service culture from one focused on “political neutrality” to “patriotism” now.
However, interpreting it as a “punishment” for civil servants but a reward for “hardliners”, as some pro-establishment figures have done, oversimplifies the implications. The reshuffle is to set the clearest criteria in meeting the new bottom line of allowing only “patriots” to govern Hong Kong”.
