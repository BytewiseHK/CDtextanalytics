The year 2024 was a disappointing one for Bollywood, the Hindi film factory in Mumbai. No Hindi movie was a superhit or took in record profits. The industry is truly worried.
Unfortunately, many films these days just focus on music and dance, neglecting the storyline. Otherwise, they are murder mysteries or revolve around crime and revenge.
Second, Bollywood films are too reliant on stars. Some of the top actors charge around 1 billion Indian rupees (US$12 million) per movie.
