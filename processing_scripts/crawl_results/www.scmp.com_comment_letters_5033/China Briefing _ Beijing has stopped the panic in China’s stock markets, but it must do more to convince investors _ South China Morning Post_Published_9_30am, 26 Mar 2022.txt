Only on March 16 did Beijing intervene to calm the markets and reassure investors with a promise of a slew of measures after the previous day saw domestic stocks slumping to 21-month lows and Chinese mainland firms listed in Hong Kong to 2008 lows.
Vice-Premier Liu He, Xi’s most trusted economic adviser, announced the market-friendly measures at a special meeting of the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, which he chaired.
