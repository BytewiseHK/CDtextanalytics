Hong Kong Museum of Art launches exhibition featuring works by Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Post-Impressionist Paul Cézanne
The showcasing of 52 French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces in Hong Kong reflects the “strong friendship” between the city and the European country, while contributing to the former’s cultural exchange ambitions, curators have told the Post.
The exhibition, titled “The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: Cézanne and Renoir Looking at the World – Masterpieces from the Musée de l’Orangerie and the Musée d’Orsay”, is being held at the Hong Kong Museum of Art and is the city’s first large-scale showcase of the two painters together.
“The fact that the paintings are here is a sign of this strong friendship. It’s a strong link,” Cécile Girardeau, curator of the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris, said in an interview last week.
She added that the exhibition was a continuation of the 60th-anniversary celebrations of diplomatic ties between China and France that took place last year.
“The language of painting or art is universal, it’s a good tool so that even people from different cultures can share something together,” she said. “It’s nice that we have them in Paris, but it’s nice that we could share them also. It’s one of our missions.”
The exhibition opened on Friday and will run until May 7, with a standard ticket priced at HK$50 (US$6.40) and a concessionary one going for HK$25.
