Mining and solar energy firms also had their imports banned, bringing the total number of companies on the trade blacklist to 144
The United States has banned imports from another tranche of Chinese companies over alleged human-rights abuses involving the Uygurs, targeting 37 textile, mining and solar companies, the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday.
The companies include Huafu Fashion, one of the world’s largest textile manufacturers, and 25 of its subsidiaries, which the US has linked to forced-labour practices in China’s cotton industry.
The companies were added to the Uygur Forced Labour Prevention Act Entity List, which restricts the import of goods tied to what the US describes as China’s human-rights abuses and ongoing genocide in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.
US authorities say Chinese authorities have established internment camps for Uygurs and other religious and ethnic minority groups in China’s western Xinjiang region. Beijing has denied any abuses.
