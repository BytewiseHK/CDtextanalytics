Faced with US and EU trade barriers that aim to curb their dominance in the global solar equipment supply chain, Chinese manufacturers have been forced to reassess their overseas expansion strategies, with the Middle East emerging as a perceived safe haven.
Since last year, several Chinese solar giants have announced plans or expressed interest in building factories in Gulf countries including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.
“The Gulf region is becoming a global hotspot for renewable energy,” said Teng Da, the Middle East and North Africa director of Chinese solar equipment maker Longi Green Energy Technology. However, analysts said Chinese manufacturers looking to escape global trade barriers and overcapacity issues through Middle East expansion may find any respite to be short-lived.
GCL said in June that it will launch its first overseas granular silicon project in the UAE. Trina Solar last year announced it would build a photovoltaic manufacturing base in the UAE with an annual capacity of about 50,000 tons of high-purity silicon, 30 gigawatts (GW) of silicon wafers, and 5GW of battery modules.
Longi said in a report last month that it is also considering Middle East expansion.
