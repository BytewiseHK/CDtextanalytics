Diplomatic negotiation is about showing your hand to bargain for the maximum interest. And when neither side accepts that the other is in any position of strength, showing up at the bargaining table is already the best result.
That is what US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman’s two-day visit to China is about.
Hong Kong is sandwiched between the two superpowers, but unlike some Asian countries with close economic ties to China facing the dilemma of picking a side, the city does not have such a choice as it is a part of China.
It is not up to Hong Kong per se – foreign businesses operating here know the city must follow Beijing’s policies. However, investment decision-making involves more considerations than geopolitics alone.
While it was widely seen as a vote of confidence in the city, the transaction could simply be a good investment deal and not necessarily AmCham contradicting the White House, as some have suggested.
