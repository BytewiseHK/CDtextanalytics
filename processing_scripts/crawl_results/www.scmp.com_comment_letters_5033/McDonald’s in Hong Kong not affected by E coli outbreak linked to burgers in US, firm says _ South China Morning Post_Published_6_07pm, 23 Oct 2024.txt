Company says ‘issue does not impact McDonald’s operations in Hong Kong in any way’
The fast food chain’s announcement on Wednesday followed reports of people falling ill after eating the burgers in the US, with the country’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting 49 cases in 10 states, with one death.
“We want to reassure our customers that this issue does not impact McDonald’s operations in Hong Kong in any way. None of the affected products or ingredients are used in our restaurants in Hong Kong,” the company said.
According to the fast food chain’s menu in the city, it does not serve the Quarter Pounder.
E coli is a pathogen which can cause gastrointestinal problems such as intestinal bleeding. It can be transmitted through drinking contaminated water or eating undercooked and contaminated foods.
US diners reportedly fell ill after eating McDonald’s Quarter Pounders, with the CDC saying investigators were working to determine whether onions were the source of the outbreak.
