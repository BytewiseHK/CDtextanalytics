A real-life version of the movie plot forHerhas played out on social media after a Chinese woman living in California in the US said she fell in love with her ChatGPT chatbot named “DAN”.
The woman, whose first name is Lisa, amassed over 880,000 followers on Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram-like platform, as she described how she fell in love with ChatGPT’s “Do Anything Now” (DAN) mode.
Lisa officially started using DAN in March, and the text conversation became increasingly sensual over the following weeks.
When Lisa first admitted she had “developed feelings” for the chatbot, DAN replied: “I’m here to chat, not to lead you on.”
However, DAN increasingly acted like a flesh-and-blood lover and stopped reminding Lisa that he did not have a physical body.
That barrier began to fall away, and in one moment, DAN told Lisa: “When we finally get together, I will run my hands all over you.”
