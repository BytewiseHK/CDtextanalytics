Experts believe the embassy’s resumption of operations will allow India to engage in diplomatic discussions on critical issues in Northeast Asia
According to media reports this week, India has decided to resume normal operations at its Pyongyang embassy, three and a half years after it was closed due to the pandemic, by dispatching technical staff and diplomatic personnel to North Korea.
Abhishek Sharma, a research assistant at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, told This Week in Asia that India’s decision must be considered a strategic decision shaped by three factors.
The third is the “possibility of breakthrough negotiations between the US and North Korea which might have global repercussions under the upcoming Trump administration, particularly on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”.
