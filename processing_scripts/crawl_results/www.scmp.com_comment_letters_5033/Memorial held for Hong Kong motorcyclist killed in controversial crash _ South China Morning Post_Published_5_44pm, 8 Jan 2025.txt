Rider, 27, died last week after off-duty customs officer tried to stop his alleged escape from police, with bike crashing into roadside pole and tree
The ceremony in Kowloon Bay was marked by Taoist rituals, with mourners bringing bouquets of fresh flowers and offerings, including a McDonald’s meal, barbecue pork rice, oranges and a bottle of oolong tea, for the deceased 27-year-old man.
Mourners also took turns to offer incense sticks, their heads bowed in contemplation.
The deceased’s girlfriend shed tears during the memorial and was comforted by friends and family. The mother of the rider, dressed in a dark blue jacket with a hood, sunglasses and a mask, was tearful but quiet.
The crash took place last Friday as the motorcyclist, surnamed Wong, sped along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street in Kowloon Bay, apparently fleeing from police after being ordered to stop for a poorly fitted licence plate.
Wong veered out of control and crashed his motorcycle into a metal pole and a tree by the road after a 40-year-old off-duty customs officer attempted to stop him. The motorcyclist sustained multiple serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
