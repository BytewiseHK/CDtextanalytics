A US think tank has said that a policy entirely based on punishment or abandonment of Hong Kong’s special status in American law would be counterproductive to the preservation of the city’s remaining autonomy.
It said Washington should aim for a pragmatic understanding of what would be best for its own interests and the city’s degree of autonomy, rather than concentrate on “symbolic opprobrium”.
“Washington would be wise to focus on sustaining what space remains for civic engagement, foreign interaction and political debate,” the report said.
“Such an approach will require patience and persistence, but it lies firmly within US interests.”
It added: “The view of this report’s authors is that a policy built entirely around punishments or giving up on Hong Kong would be counterproductive and result in the further undermining of whatever autonomy remains.”
