Scalpers are putting city’s reputation at risk and authorities need to act for the sake of the ‘concert economy’
Ticket touts may well be cheering their improved prospects for cashing in on the “concert economy” that Hong Kong hopes can help boost its post-pandemic recovery. Authorities, meanwhile, have drawn jeers from lawmakers after it emerged there have been no convictions for scalping in years, despite a decades-old law against it.
Lawmakers accused the government of inaction after officials admitted making no successful prosecutions under the Public Entertainment Ordinance in a 30-month period from 2022. Officials also told the Legislative Council they were studying options to outlaw scalping at city-operated venues – reiterating a more than six-year-old pledge to update a law from 1941.
Current regulations prohibit the offering or selling of tickets at more than the fixed price for events held at licensed venues. Unauthorised sales even at regular prices are also banned in public thoroughfares, entrance halls or approaches to such venues.
Those caught face fines of up to HK$2,000 (US$257), but the law does not cover venues managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.
Some legislators are worried that scalping may hurt the image of Hong Kong, especially if touts are the first to greet visitors at the main stadium of the soon-to-open Kai Tak Sports Park. Others fear inflated ticket prices may curb visitor spending on hotels and in other areas.
