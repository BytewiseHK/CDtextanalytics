Police say man was deceived by an advert seeking agents to bring diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan
One more Hongkonger has returned home safely after being released from a “scam farm” in Myanmar, with police revealing the man was deceived by an advert seeking agents to bring diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
Police said on Thursday that the man’s family members were asked to pay US$30,000 for his release but did not reveal whether the ransom was paid. However, a former district councillor who had been helping the family said some money was paid.
Chief Inspector Lau Ho-tak of the Kowloon East regional crime unit said the man departed Hong Kong for Thailand on October 13 last year after “being hired” to bring diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan for HK$120,000 through a social media post.
“On the day he arrived at the airport in Bangkok, locals immediately arranged for a private car to take him. During the subsequent journey of a few hours, he changed vehicles multiple times,” he said.
“When he arrived at the border of Thailand and Myanmar, he realised he might have been scammed and attempted to flee but failed. He was immediately taken to a compound on a mountain in Myanmar.”
Lau said that, according to the victim, individuals in military uniforms patrolled the area, armed with guns.
