More tenacity needed in fighting the biggest threat to the Communist Party, Xi tells disciplinary body
Addressing a gathering of the elite of China’s top anti-corruption agency on Monday, Xi said China’s anti-corruption efforts had yielded clear results but officials should “maintain tenacity and perseverance in the fight against corruption … and resolutely fight this tough, protracted and all-out battle”.
“Corruption is the biggest threat facing the [Communist] Party, and countering corruption is the most thorough form of self-revolution,” Xi told a plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, according to state news agency Xinhua.
“The current situation in the fight against corruption remains grave and complex. The existing amount of corruption has not been eliminated and new cases have continued to occur.
“The task of eradicating the breeding grounds and conditions for corruption remains arduous and burdensome.”
The CCDI is meeting in the capital this week, with progress in the anti-corruption drive the main item on the agenda.
Xi also told the cadres that China’s battle against corruption must be “unwavering”, adding that “any hesitation, slackness or giving up halfway will lead to subversive mistakes”.
