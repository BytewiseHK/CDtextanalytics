Security chief Chris Tang meets Myanmar’s consul general in city to follow up on job scams
The bureau said on Friday travellers needed to adjust plans and avoid non-essential visits to the districts of Myawaddy, Hpapun, Hpa-An and Kawkareik. Those who were already there should monitor the situation, exercise caution and look after their personal safety.
For the rest of the country, the alert remains at the amber level, which indicates Hongkongers should monitor the situation and exercise caution upon travel.
The city’s outbound travel warnings follow a three-tier system. The most severe warning is black, which means avoid all travel, followed by red and amber.
The bureau also reminded Hongkongers to beware of job scams when travelling to Cambodia.
Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung said he met with Han Win Naing, Myanmar’s consul general in Hong Kong, on Friday to share information and discuss future follow-up work.
