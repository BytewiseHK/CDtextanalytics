At least six people including Pakistani paramilitary troops were killed and scores injured on Saturday, in a bombing claimed by separatists in volatile southwestern Balochistan province, officials said.
A bus carrying paramilitary troops of the Frontier Corps (FC) was travelling from the port city of Karachi to southwestern Turbat city when it was targeted around 7km (4 miles) west of the city.
“At least six people, including FC soldiers and civilians, were killed in a bomb attack on a bus,” senior local police official Rashid-ur-Rehman told Agence France-Presse.
More than 25 people were injured in the incident, he said, declining to provide further details.
A senior local security official said it was an apparent suicide attack and the paramilitary troops were targeted.
The official also confirmed the death toll to Agence France-Presse.
