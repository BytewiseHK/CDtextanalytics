Airport Authority to cover rest of HK$100 billion ‘landmark’ project featuring marina, hotel and ‘jet fresh market’
Cissy Chan Ching-sze, the authority’s commercial executive director, said on Thursday the body would cover the remaining HK$30 billion of the HK$100 billion expansion called “Skytopia”.
“We will fund it with our internal resources. And then for the other initiatives, we will work with the private sector accordingly,” she said.
Chan was speaking at an event that welcomed 300 business leaders from Hong Kong, mainland China and overseas to learn more about the expansion of the authority’s Airport City development blueprint.
Skytopia will feature an arts hub, a 600-berth yacht marina, the city’s largest water recreation area, a “jet fresh market” to rival Tokyo’s Tsukiji Fish Market and a development called Skycity that will host a hotel, offices and commercial activities.
“The project is expected to cost around HK$100 billion, of which about HK$30 billion will be on infrastructure costs,” Chan said.
