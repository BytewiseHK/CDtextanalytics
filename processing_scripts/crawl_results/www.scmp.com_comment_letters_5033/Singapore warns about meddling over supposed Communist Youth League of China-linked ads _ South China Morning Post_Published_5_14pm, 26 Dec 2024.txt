The deleted job offers on LinkedIn list two roles at a supposed Ngee Ann Polytechnic branch of the Communist Party of China’s youth wing
“The Singapore government will not tolerate the importation of the politics of other countries into Singapore. Foreigners visiting, studying, working or living in Singapore should not carry out their political agendas or activities here. We will deal firmly with any individual or group found to be doing so,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in response to queries from This Week in Asia.
According to a report by the government-owned broadsheet The Straits Times, the two job listings were posted on LinkedIn on December 20 by an account on the professional social networking site that named itself the Communist Youth League of China, which comes under the Communist Party of China.
The listings were for a party branch secretary and deputy branch secretary for a supposed Ngee Ann Polytechnic branch of the youth league.
The account and job listings have since been taken down.
“The Ministry of Home Affairs [MHA] is aware of job offers on LinkedIn supposedly related to a branch of the Communist Party of China and its Communist Youth League, in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Police reports have been received and MHA is looking into the case,” the ministry said.
