Post is seen as important role to carry out what is expected to be a tough economic agenda against China
US president-elect Donald Trump has nominated Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager, to be the country’s next Treasury secretary, a key player in carrying out what is expected to be a tough economic agenda against China.
“I am most pleased to nominate Scott Bessent to serve as the 79th Secretary of the Treasury of the United States,” Trump said in a statement released on Truth Social. “Scott is widely respected as one of the world’s foremost international investors and geopolitical and economic strategists.
“On the eve of our Great Country’s 250th Anniversary, he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy,” he said.
While most incoming administrations customarily do not announce their cabinet nominees until later in the 10-week transition period, Trump has been naming his at a much faster pace, with a string of selections for other leading positions in the two weeks since he won the election.
Those have included Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Fox News commentator Peter Hegseth for defence secretary, both pronounced China hawks.
