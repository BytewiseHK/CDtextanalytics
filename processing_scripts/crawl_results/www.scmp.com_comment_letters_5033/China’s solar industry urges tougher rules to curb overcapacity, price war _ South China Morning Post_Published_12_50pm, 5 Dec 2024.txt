China’s photovoltaic makers seek stricter market control amid price war and overcapacity, similar to those for the steel and cement industries
China’s solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers have renewed their call urging the government to regulate the market following moves to curb overcapacity, after an industry pledge to end a price war did not have the desired effect.
Beijing’s recent measures to control excess supply in the PV industry are far from enough, said Xu Xinfeng, a senior vice-president at Shanghai-based Aiko Solar.
“There is still a need for more macro-control from the government and more policies,” Xu said at China’s annual solar industry conference in Yibin, southwestern Sichuan province, on Wednesday.
