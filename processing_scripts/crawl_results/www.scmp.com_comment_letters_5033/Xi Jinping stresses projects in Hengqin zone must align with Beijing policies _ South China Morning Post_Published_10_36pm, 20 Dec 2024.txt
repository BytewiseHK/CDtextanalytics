Central government developing Hengqin to promote diversification of Macau’s economy and give convenience to residents, president says at inauguration of city’s new leader
Chinese President Xi Jinping said projects in the Hengqin cooperation zone in Zhuhai must not be inconsistent with Beijing’s policy goals in an unusual warning made during his speech at the inauguration of Macau’s new leader on Friday.
In his speech conveying his hopes for the incoming Sam Hou-fai administration on Friday, Xi urged Macau to “pinpoint its focus” on creating a more diversified economy, improve industrial development planning, increase policy support and capital investment, while also striving to cultivate new industries that were competitive on a global scale.
Singling out the Guangdong-Macau In-depth Cooperation Zone, which covers Hengqin island across from the gaming hub, Xi called on authorities to ensure its development was aligned with Macau’s economic goals and for “iconic” projects that supported diversification be included.
Xi also urged the government to help direct capital into businesses and industries that were scalable and could compete on an international level.
“The central government decided to develop Hengqin in order to promote the appropriately diversified development of Macau’s economy and bring convenience to the life and employment of Macau residents,” he said.
“This positioning must be grasped well, and projects that are inconsistent with this positioning cannot be developed.”
Newly sworn in economy minister Tai Kin-ip told reporters after meeting the president that the government was studying the advice on Hengqin development carefully.
