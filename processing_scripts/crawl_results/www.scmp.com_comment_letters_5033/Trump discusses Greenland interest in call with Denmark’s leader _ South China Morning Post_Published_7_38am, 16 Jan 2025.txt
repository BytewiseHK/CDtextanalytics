Danish PM Mette Frederiksen repeated that the island is not for sale and said ‘it is up to Greenland itself to decide on independence’
Donald Trump confirmed his interest in acquiring Greenland for the US, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said following a 45-minute phone call with the incoming US president on Wednesday.
“There is no doubt that there is great interest in and around Greenland,” Frederiksen said in an interview with broadcaster TV2 after the phone call.
“Based on the conversation I had today, there is no reason to believe that it should be less than what we have heard in the public debate.”
The Wednesday call is the first time Frederiksen and Trump have spoken since the US president-elect last week reiterated his plans to take over Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, and would not rule out using military or economic coercion to achieve his goal.
Both Frederiksen and Greenland’s Prime Minister Mute B. Egede have said the Arctic island is not for sale, a point the Danish premier also stressed in her phone call with Trump, according to a statement from her office.
