Xia Baolong also calls on Hong Kong and Macau to fully unleash the benefits of the ‘one country, two systems’ governing principle
The president also demanded that Macau stay on track in diversifying its economy, push for reforms in public administration, expand the city’s international connections and ensure social harmony and stability.
Xia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told a seminar in Beijing that “the spirit of these important instructions also applies to Hong Kong”.
“Hong Kong and Macau must excel in fostering internal and external connections, so as to best unleash the benefits of one country, two systems both inside and outside [the country], polish their international brands even brighter, and demonstrate greater achievements on the international stage,” Xia was quoted as saying in a statement by his office.
