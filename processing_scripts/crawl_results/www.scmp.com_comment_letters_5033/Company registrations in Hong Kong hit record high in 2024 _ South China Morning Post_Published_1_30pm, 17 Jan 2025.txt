More than 145,000 local businesses were established last year and 1,079 non-Hong Kong companies set up offices
Registrations of local and non-Hong Kong companies in the city reached all-time highs in 2024.
While the Companies Registry said on Friday that it had made the process easier, a lawmaker attributed the increase to the governmentâ€™s recent aggressive efforts in attracting overseas firms.
Last year, 145,053 local businesses were established, bringing the number of firms registered under the Companies Ordinance to 1.46 million.
The registry said the overall number of local firms increased by 29,736 compared with 2023, calling it an all-time high figure.
A total of 1,079 non-Hong Kong companies set up offices in the city last year.
By the end of 2024, the total number of registered non-local companies had increased by 2 per cent over the previous year to 15,126, which was also a record high, according to the registry.
