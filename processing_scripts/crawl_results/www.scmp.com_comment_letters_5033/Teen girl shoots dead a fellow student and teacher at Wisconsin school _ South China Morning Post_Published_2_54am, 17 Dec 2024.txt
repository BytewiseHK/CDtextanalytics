Police chief says shooter shot herself dead after rampage at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison
A 15-year-old girl opened fire in a Wisconsin school classroom on Monday, fatally shooting a fellow student and a teacher and wounding six other people before killing herself with the handgun, police said.
The shooting took place in a mixed-grade study hall shortly before 11am at the Abundant Life Christian School, which has 420 students from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade.
The shooter was a student at the school, identified by police as Natalie Rupnow, who also went by the name Samantha.
A second-grade student, who would generally be 7 or 8 years old, called 911 to report the shooting at the school, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told a press conference.
“Let that soak in for a minute,” Barnes said.
