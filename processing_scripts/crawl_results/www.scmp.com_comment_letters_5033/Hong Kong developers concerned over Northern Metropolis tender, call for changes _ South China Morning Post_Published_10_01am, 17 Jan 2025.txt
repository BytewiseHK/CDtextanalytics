Government will award the tender to the highest bidder without providing discounts or incentives to attract companies, source says
A source from a firm that attended a briefing session on the scheme also said the project details were not attractive enough due to the high investment required.
During the session on Thursday, the Development Bureau laid out details and development requirements of the three plots earmarked for the large-scale land disposal scheme. It also introduced an execution model to help interested parties decide how to use the land.
Nearly half of the companies that attended the briefing were believed to be from mainland China, according to the source.
But some developers did not agree with the tendering process.
“The tender will be awarded to the highest bidder and the government has confirmed that it will not provide any discounts or incentives to attract companies,” the insider said.
