Feelings of failure mostly due to academic performance, according to Hong Kong Christian Service, which urges more mental health support
The Hong Kong Christian Service released the findings of its survey on Saturday and said the high ratings on its “failure index” showed the need for strong support networks.
“This highlighted a critical need for a shift in society’s attitudes towards failure, emphasising the importance of the support network, including family, schools and peers, for young people in facing challenges to improve their mental health and achievement motive,” said Apple Ngo Hoi-ling, a service supervisor at a club run by the organisation in Sham Shui Po.
The Christian Service conducted the survey between June and September, interviewing 597 people aged 12 to 24 to look into their experiences with failure and the impact it has on them.
The findings showed that 48.3 per cent of respondents rated their “failure index” at 6 or above out of 10, indicating a tendency to view themselves as failures. A higher score indicates greater feelings of failure.
More than three-quarters of respondents said their most serious failures were related to academic achievement. Others said their failures were tied to personal development and interpersonal relationships.
The average score stood at 5.6, with most people defining failure as not achieving personal goals, being unable to demonstrate their strengths and abilities, as well as falling short of meeting others’ expectations.
