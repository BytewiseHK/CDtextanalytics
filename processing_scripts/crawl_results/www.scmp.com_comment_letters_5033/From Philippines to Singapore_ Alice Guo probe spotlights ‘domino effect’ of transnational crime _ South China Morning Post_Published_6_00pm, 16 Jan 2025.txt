Zhang Jie, one of Guo’s alleged associates, is a Singaporean national who purportedly helped in her escape from the Philippines last year
The Singapore Police Force told local newspaper The Straits Times last week that it was working with Philippine authorities on the case due to the alleged involvement of Guo’s associates in the city state.
The force said it would deal with the suspects firmly “in accordance with our laws” should it receive “credible evidence” of their alleged offences, adding, “We do not tolerate anyone who may have committed crimes overseas and will take firm action against them if we have sufficient grounds.”
She fled the country in July last year after being grilled by a Senate investigation and was later arrested by Indonesian authorities in Tangerang in August.

She evaded Philippine authorities amid continued Senate hearings in July, reportedly travelling to Malaysia by boat first before flying to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur on July 21, where she stayed for a month, and then travelled to Batam in Indonesia by ferry on August 18.
