Avian influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on a combination of two proteins found on their surfaces – hemagglutinin and neuraminidase – referred to as HxNy.
Only two subtypes of avian influenza A – H1N1 and H3N2 – are known to circulate between humans, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.

Chinese study finds new evidence that the world could be on the brink of another pandemic
A study led by China’s top virologist has raised concerns that a strain of the virus H2N2 recently found in the wild can now infect humans, raising the need for higher surveillance.
Decades ago, another strain of H2N2 was responsible for the “Asian flu” pandemic, which broke out in 1957 in southern China and quickly spread around the world, claiming more than 1 million lives, according to the CDC.
