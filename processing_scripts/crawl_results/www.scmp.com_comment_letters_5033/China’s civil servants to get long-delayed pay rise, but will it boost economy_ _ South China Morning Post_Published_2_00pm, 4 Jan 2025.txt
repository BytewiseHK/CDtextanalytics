Public sector workers expect salary increase ahead of Lunar New Year, but some warn impact could be limited after years of belt-tightening
They said the amount, ranging from 300 to 500 yuan (US$41 to US$69), would be effective before the holiday, also known as the Spring Festival, which this year falls on January 29. But the exact amount will vary depending on location, local budgets, position and seniority.
An official in the central government in Beijing said he and his colleagues were formally notified about the pay rise in the last week of December.
“It certainly helps to improve morale in the office as the festive season is just around the corner. But we are also reminded not to openly discuss it,” he said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
For those whose pay will rise by 500 yuan, the net increase in take-home pay is around 350 yuan after social security contributions.
