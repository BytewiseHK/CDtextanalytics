Jensen Huang is set to tour the mainland Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing, before flying to Taipei later this week
The Nvidia CEO is expected to arrive in Shenzhen for employees’ annual Lunar New Year celebrations around January 15, days before US president-elect Donald Trump gets sworn in for a second term, according to people familiar with the matter.
The co-founder also planned to visit Shanghai and Beijing, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private matter. And he would fly to Taipei later this week, another person familiar with his travel plans said.
Huang is touring China at a sensitive time for the company, which has been ensnared in the broader US-China tech conflict as the foremost producer of chips for AI development.
