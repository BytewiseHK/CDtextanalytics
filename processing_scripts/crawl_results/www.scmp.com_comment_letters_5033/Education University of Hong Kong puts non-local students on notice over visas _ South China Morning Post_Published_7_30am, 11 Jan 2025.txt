University finds more than 900 students from outside city failed to submit visa information as required
The Education University of Hong Kong (EdU) will review its mechanism for reminding non-local students about submitting their visa details to the institution after finding more than 900 had failed to do so.
The Immigration Department said on Friday it was seriously concerned about the matter, calling the 934 students involved a “significant” number.
EdU said it would create a task force to review the mechanism for reminding students to submit visa information in a timely manner after a recent check uncovered the scale of the problem.
“Applying for a visa and submitting the relevant documents is the personal responsibility of each non-local student,” a spokesman said.
“EdU has always emphasised the importance of law-abiding behaviour and adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards illegal activities.”
The review came after the university notified authorities in September of last year that a non-local student was no longer studying at the school. In October, the department informed the university the student had overstayed.
