If the bill is passed, organisations would have to disclose foreign and anonymous donations, foreign affiliations and their leadership composition
Singapore introduced legislation on Tuesday to safeguard clans and business associations linked to racial groups against foreign interference.
If passed, the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill will allow a “competent authority” to designate such organisations as “race-based entities”.
The organisations would then have to disclose foreign and anonymous donations, foreign affiliations and their leadership composition.
The government can also impose a restraining order to stop an entity from accepting donations from a foreign principal, prohibit anonymous donations or require the entity to return or dispose of donations.
In a media statement, the home affairs ministry said: “Singapore is vulnerable to external actors exerting malicious foreign influence to exploit race or undermine our racial harmony, to achieve their agenda. Organisations that promote the interests of a racial group or subgroup are potential entry points for such influence.”
Singapore’s resident population is 74 per cent Chinese, 13.6 per cent Malay, and 9 per cent Indian; 3.3 per cent is classified as others.
