Strategic rivalry is a long-term battle, and China’s influence will only grow, observers say in response to Joe Biden’s farewell claims
The United States might indeed have consolidated its power and shored up Asia-Pacific alliances under the Biden administration, but Beijing’s influence will continue to grow, according to observers in China.
China viewed its strategic rivalry with the US as a long-term battle, and had been able to consolidate its status in key areas of the global economy, they noted.
“On China’s current course, they will never surpass us,” he said, citing the “latest predictions”.
His administration had stood up against Beijing’s “unfair practices”, Biden said, as he listed diplomatic gains ahead of his departure from the White House next week.
“We’ve made partnerships stronger and created new partnerships to challenge China’s aggressive behaviour and to rebalance power in the region,” he said.
