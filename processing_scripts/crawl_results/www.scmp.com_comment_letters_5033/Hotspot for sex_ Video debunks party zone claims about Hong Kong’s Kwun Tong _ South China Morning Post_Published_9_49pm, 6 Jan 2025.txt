Several revellers interviewed at Kwun Tong Promenade said they had seen scuffles, but rarely hookups in public toilets
A viral video capturing Hong Kong’s Kwun Tong Promenade’s reputed role as the “Lan Kwai Fong of Gen Z” during a countdown celebration has offered a glimpse into the area’s vibrant nightlife filled with spontaneous connections and intimate moments with strangers.
While the free hugs and kisses on offer that night attracted criticism online, frontline youth workers assured those occurrences were “extremely rare” and cautioned parents against overreacting.
In the video released last Thursday, YouTuber EG Tsang Hin-man visited the Kwun Tong Promenade on New Year’s Eve, interviewing dozens of revellers aged 14 to 22 to document the thriving scene and gauge whether widely-circulated rumours were true that the place was a hotspot for hooking up.
The footage showed crowds of well-dressed young people hanging out and drinking with friends, or someone they met at the scene, with a few buskers filling the air with music and dance performances.
Amid the lively atmosphere, some strangers exchanged free hugs and kisses as playful gestures of connection. A guy claimed he had kissed dozens of girls there.
Some of the revellers featured in the video said they had seen scuffles, but rarely hookups in public toilets.
