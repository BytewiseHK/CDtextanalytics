Has Beijing sent in a senior party official for more “supervision” of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the Hong Kong government?
What raised eyebrows was Luo’s request to his colleagues accompanying him to help find a job “as soon as possible” for an unemployed man they visited in his 80 sq ft subdivided flat.
To set the record straight, Luo’s predecessors Zhang Xiaoming and Wang Zhimin made similar community outreach visits in the past, but Luo went a step beyond greeting residents to directly seek help for them.
The timing was well picked too, as October 1 this year was not only National Day but also coincided with the traditional family reunion part of the Mid-Autumn Festival.
