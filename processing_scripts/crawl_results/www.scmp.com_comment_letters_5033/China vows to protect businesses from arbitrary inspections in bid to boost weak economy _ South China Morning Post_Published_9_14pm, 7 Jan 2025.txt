New directive is latest move to address companies’ complaints about government interference and fines targeting private enterprises
Hu made the comments at a press briefing held to highlight a document – issued on Friday by the State Council, China’s cabinet – regulating government inspections of private companies. He was among three officials from the Ministry of Justice, which drafted the document, to attend the event.
Private businesses, which serve as the backbone of job creation, investment and innovation in China, have voiced concerns that frequent administrative inspections by local governments interfere with their normal operations and enable rent-seeking.
The directive acknowledged problems including frequent and arbitrary inspections as well as “campaign-style inspections” and inspections “disguised under different names”.
