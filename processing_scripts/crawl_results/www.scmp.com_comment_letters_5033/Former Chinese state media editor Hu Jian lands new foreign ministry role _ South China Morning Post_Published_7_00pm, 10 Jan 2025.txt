Ex-journalist Hu has called for ‘debunking lies’ about China from Western countries
Hu has been named the top-ranked among four deputy directors of the foreign ministry’s personnel department, according to the ministry’s official website on Friday. It is his second position within the ministry.
Hu, 46, is a veteran journalist who worked for Nanfang Daily Newspaper Group in the southern city of Guangzhou, where he covered domestic current affairs.
In 2020, he joined the foreign ministry’s department of press, communication and public diplomacy as a deputy director. At the time, the state-run Global Times cited Hu as an example of the ministry’s attempts to draw from beyond the usual diplomatic talent pool.
In his previous role at the ministry, Hu called for “improving the persuasiveness of China’s discourse”, including “debunking lies” from Western countries about China by using facts, according to Chinese media reports.
