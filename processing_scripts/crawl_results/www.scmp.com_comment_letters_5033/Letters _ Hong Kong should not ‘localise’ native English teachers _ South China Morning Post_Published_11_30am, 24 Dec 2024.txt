Readers discuss how the Native-speaking English Teacher Scheme is failing to serve students, Christmas decorations in Hong Kong, and the lack thereof
It is high time the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET) Scheme is reviewed. The scheme was introduced by the Education Bureau expressly to enhance the teaching of the language and increase students’ exposure to English.
When working at a school years ago, I conducted interviews to recruit teachers under the NET Scheme. Every teacher on the shortlist was older than 40 and two were close to retirement age; there was hardly any fresh blood.
Those with experience in teaching regular English classes came across as dignified, even defensive, rather than enthusiastic and energised. The longer these native English teachers have worked in Hong Kong, the less lively and creative they seem to become, having had to manage with limited resources and lesson time to meet the huge number of tasks expected of them.
Assimilated, even fossilised, by the system, they gradually lose the ability to enliven the learning atmosphere. They start to look no different from local English teachers and become less appealing to students.
When a native English teacher is made to take on a regular class instead of giving oral lessons to say, six to eight classes, far fewer students are exposed to their native-level English and teaching. Forcing them to teach a full and demanding curriculum also takes away from their ability to engage in lively and authentic English discourse. Students might even find them intimidating because they are involved in assessment.
