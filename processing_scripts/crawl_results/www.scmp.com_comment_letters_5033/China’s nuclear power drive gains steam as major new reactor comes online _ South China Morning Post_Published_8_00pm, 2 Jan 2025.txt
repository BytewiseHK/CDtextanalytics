The project in Fujian province is the first example of China’s third-generation Hualong One reactor being put into large-scale commercial operation
China’s rapidly expanding nuclear power industry passed a major milestone on New Year’s Day, as the first reactor at a sprawling new plant on the country’s southeastern coastline started feeding power into the national grid.
The move marks the first time a Hualong One – China’s third-generation nuclear reactor – has been put into large-scale commercial operation, according to its developer, as China cranks up its efforts to become a leading player in nuclear energy.
The plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, is set to be China’s largest nuclear facility using third-generation technology, with plans for six reactors each with a capacity of over a million kilowatts.
The first reactor at the plant passed safety evaluations and went into operation on January 1, and another four are currently under construction.
China has made significant investments in developing its nuclear power capabilities in recent years, as it seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign technology and ramp up its clean energy capacity.
Each reactor produces enough power to cut China’s coal consumption by 3.12 million tons per year, saving 8.16 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
