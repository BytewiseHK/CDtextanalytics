I am a food fanatic – I love to eat and my close friends know that, as part of my dining ritual, I snap photos of the dishes and share them on my social networks. Food is not only a necessity and a platform for socialising, but also provides a deep connection to my personal history and cultural heritage.
And Chinese food remains my favourite as it reminds me of home. As a first-generation Chinese-American, food is a powerful link to the language, holidays and celebrations that I have worked hard to hold on to, knowing how fragile it can all be.
As a result, most Asian restaurants and markets are suffering. The irony is that Chinese restaurants and Asian food markets are known for reliably serving people of all races and ethnicities. The Chinese chain supermarkets that began opening in New York’s upscale suburbs in recent years draw a robust Caucasian population attracted to the fresh foods and diversity of produce.
