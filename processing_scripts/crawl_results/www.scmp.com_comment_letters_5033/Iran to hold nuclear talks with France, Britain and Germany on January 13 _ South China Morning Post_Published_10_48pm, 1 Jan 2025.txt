The 3 European nations had accused Iran of growing its stockpile of high-enriched uranium to ‘unprecedented levels’
“The new round of talks between Iran and three European countries will be held in Geneva on January 13,” said Kazem Gharibabadi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs, according to ISNA news agency.
He added the talks were only “consultations, not negotiations”.
The three European countries had on December 17 accused Iran of growing its stockpile of high-enriched uranium to “unprecedented levels” without “any credible civilian justification”.
They also raised the possibility of restoring sanctions against Iran to keep it from developing its nuclear programme.
Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said his country was “ready for fair and honourable negotiations” with the West.
