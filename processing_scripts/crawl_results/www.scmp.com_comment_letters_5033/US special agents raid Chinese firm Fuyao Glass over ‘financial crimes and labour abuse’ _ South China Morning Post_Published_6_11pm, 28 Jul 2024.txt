Hundreds of special agents from multiple US law enforcement agencies, including Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigations and the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants at the Fuyao plant in Moraine, Ohio and 27 other locations in the Dayton metropolitan area on Friday.
“Special agents are on scene investigating allegations of financial crimes and labour exploitation,” a statement from Homeland Security said.
An observer in China warned that the raids could become a “talking point” in the US presidential election.
The investigation comes at a time when US politicians continue to plan containment measures targeting China ahead of November’s presidential election. They also coincided with Beijing’s announcement of a Chinese business delegation’s visit to the United States from Saturday “to consolidate economic and trade cooperation”.
Homeland Security officials said activities tied to the investigation were going on in Dayton, Liberty Township, Miamisburg, Moraine and West Carrollton.
