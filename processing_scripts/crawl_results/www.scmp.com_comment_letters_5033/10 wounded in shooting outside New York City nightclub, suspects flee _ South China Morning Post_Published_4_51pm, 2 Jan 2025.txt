At least three gunmen fired more than 30 shots at a crowd of people waiting outside Queens club holding memorial for slain teen
Ten people were wounded in a shooting Wednesday night outside a nightclub in New York City that was holding a memorial for a teenager who had been previously been killed in the city.
Police said three or four men fired about 30 shots at a crowd of people who were standing outside Amazura Concert Hall in Jamaica, Queens, for the private event before running to a car and driving off.
Six females and four males between the ages of 16 and 20 were taken to hospitals but are expected to recover, police said.
Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said the club was holding a small private event to celebrate the life of a teen who had been killed in Brooklyn late last year.
“They just wanted to cause destruction,” he said of the shooters.
In a statement on social media, Governor Kathy Hochul said “a memorial for a teen lost to gun violence turned to horror when gunmen opened fire on the crowd.”
