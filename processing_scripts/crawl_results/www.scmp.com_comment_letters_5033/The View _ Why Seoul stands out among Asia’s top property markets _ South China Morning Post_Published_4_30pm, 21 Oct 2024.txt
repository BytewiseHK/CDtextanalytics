South Korea’s capital is in an enviable position as its office sector remains strong and its living sector holds considerable promise
The average global office vacancy rate stood at 17 per cent at the end of the second quarter of this year, up from 10 per cent before the pandemic struck. Moreover, the office sector’s share of global investment transaction volumes fell from nearly 35 per cent in 2019 to 22 per cent last year, according to JLL.
The scope for growth is greatest in Asia. The living sector in the region has accounted for just 6 per cent of investment activity since 2019 compared with 44 per cent in the United States, according to CBRE data.
