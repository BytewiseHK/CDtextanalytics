Foreign ministry says it encourages and supports people-to-people exchanges
“We believe that no matter what platforms you use, it’s a personal choice and we encourage and support people-to-people exchanges,” ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said when asked whether China would “strengthen censorship on content by foreign users due to national security interests”.
“Let me say broadly that the US needs to earnestly respect the principles of the market economy and fair competition, and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for companies doing business in the US,” Guo said.
The US Congress passed legislation banning TikTok in March amid concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate content and gain access to user data through the app.
