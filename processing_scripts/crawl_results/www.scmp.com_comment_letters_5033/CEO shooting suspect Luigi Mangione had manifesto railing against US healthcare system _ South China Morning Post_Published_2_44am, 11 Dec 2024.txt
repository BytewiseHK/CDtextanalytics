Handwritten document could indicate for the first time a possible motive for the murder of UnitedHealthcare chief Brian Thompson
The man charged with brazenly gunning down a top health insurance CEO in New York carried a handwritten manifesto of grievances against the industry, police said Tuesday, giving a possible motive for the first time.
Luigi Mangione, 26, yelled and struggled with officers as he was led into court in Pennsylvania wearing an orange jumpsuit, for a hearing on extraditing him back to New York.
He is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street last week, triggering a nationwide manhunt that ended Monday when he was recognised at a McDonald’s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
Mangione fought his extradition to New York, a complaint which Blair County prosecutor Peter Weeks described as creating “more hoops … to jump through”, and a judge denied him bail as the process continues.
The defence lawyers now have 14 days to submit motions against moving Mangione to New York, Weeks said.
