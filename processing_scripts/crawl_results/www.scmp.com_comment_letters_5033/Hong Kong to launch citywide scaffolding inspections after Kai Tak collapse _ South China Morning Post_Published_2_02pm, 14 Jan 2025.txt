Labour minister makes pledge just hours before another industrial accident in Lam Tin in which rolling shovel truck causes three injuries
Hong Kong authorities will conduct citywide safety inspections on large-scale scaffolding projects and hold a stakeholder conference to look at reducing risks, the labour minister has said after a bamboo structure collapsed at a construction site in Kai Tak and left 11 workers injured.
Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun Yuk-han made the pledge early on Tuesday, just hours before another industrial accident occurred at a construction site in Lam Tin, where an excavator rolled down a slope, and hit a noise barrier and a rubbish truck, injuring three people.
In a social media post, Sun said he was very concerned about the accident on Monday afternoon in Kai Tak, at a site where a new hospital is being built.
“I express my deepest condolences to the injured workers and wish them a speedy recovery. The Labour Department immediately dispatched staff to the scene to investigate and issued six suspension notices requiring the cessation of work on the scaffolding,” he said.
Sun said the department would look into the cause of the accident, investigate the legal responsibilities of the relevant parties and propose improvement measures.
“If any violations are found during the investigation, [those responsible] will be dealt with in accordance with the law,’ he said.
