Lam’s current office at One Pacific Place has been under scrutiny for costing taxpayers an estimated HK$9.17 million last year
A source told the Post that Immigration Tower in Wan Chai, the former headquarters of the Immigration Department, would house Lam’s new workplace, which is currently under renovation.
The relocation follows months of scrutiny after her current office at One Pacific Place in Admiralty was revealed to have cost taxpayers an estimated HK$9.17 million (US$1.17 million) in the 2023-24 financial year, including a hefty rent of HK$5.67 million.
The department relocated its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O last June, years after Lam in 2017 announced plans to demolish Immigration Tower and two nearby government buildings and redevelop them into convention, hotel and commercial facilities.
Completed in 1990, the tower is part of a three-part government office complex in Wan Chai that also includes Revenue Tower and Wan Chai Tower.
Back in 2008, the government announced plans to relocate the departments housed in the three office towers elsewhere to open up the land for private redevelopment.
