Israel, Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire deal for withdrawal of Israeli forces, hostage release
Qatar and the United States announced Wednesday a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas, adding that they hoped it would pave the way for a permanent end to the war in Gaza.
After mediators said a deal had been reached, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the “final details” were being worked on.
Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for their help securing the agreement, his office said.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the “right move” to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of official Israeli figures.
