Commodities market would ‘create a new growth point for Hong Kong’s economy’, report from Better Hong Kong Foundation says
A Hong Kong commodities market focused on materials critical to clean energy and other emerging industries would elevate the city’s importance in global trade while providing a strategic alternative for economies and companies worldwide, according to a local private think tank.
Such a market would help commodities buyers avoid having all their eggs in one basket in Western markets, the Better Hong Kong Foundation said in a report on Wednesday.
“Developing the commodity market is an important measure to create a new growth point for Hong Kong’s economy,” added the report, which is based on nine months of research with commodity-market participants and the China Development Institute in Shenzhen.
The suggestions and strategies made in the report are based on industry needs, said the foundation, which was established in 1995 by influential Hong Kong business and community leaders.
