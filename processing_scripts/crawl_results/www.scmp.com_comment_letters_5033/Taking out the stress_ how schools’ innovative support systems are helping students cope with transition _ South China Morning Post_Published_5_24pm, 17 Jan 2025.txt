Changing schools can be daunting for children, but with support from parents and educators, the experience can lead to growth and confidence
Change is a natural part of growing up, but some transitions can be particularly challenging especially for students facing a new school year, a new school environment, moving to a different country, or making the leap from primary to secondary school. These experiences can often be overwhelming and leave students feeling intimidated as they encounter new routines, expectations and social dynamics.
It is for these reasons that educators have long touted the importance of managing transitions in a positive way, especially considering they play a crucial role in shaping a child’s development.
“If left unaddressed, these challenges can have long-lasting consequences on a child’s self-esteem and overall well-being,” explains Jo Crimmins, secondary school assistant principal at Hong Kong Academy (HKA).
While transitions can seem challenging, the reality is that students are resilient and largely able to navigate these changes, especially with the right support.
“Change can be overwhelming, but it can also be invigorating. While it may be initially daunting, children typically cope well with phases of transition, inspired by a deep-rooted desire to be more like their older peers,” says Ben Keeling, principal at Shrewsbury Hong Kong.
