Last week, Shanghai-listed medical services provider Suzhou MedicalSystem Tech announced it is investing 1.86 billion yuan (US$272.4 million) in building a solar cell manufacturing plant in Mianyang, Sichuan province. The plant is expected to have an annual production capacity of 9 gigawatts (GW), and the company has signed an agreement with the local government to start construction within the next two years, according to Suzhou MedicalSystem Tech.
“The global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and a strong installation market have driven up demand for [advanced solar-panel technology],” said Qi Haishen, president of The Solar, a Beijing-based new-energy firm. “It’s a good development opportunity for companies in the photovoltaics business.”
Some of the solar sector’s biggest players have also made capacity expansion plans. Longi announced last month that it had signed investment cooperation agreements with authorities in Shaanxi province to construct a project with an annual output of 100GW of mono wafers and 50GW of mono cells.
