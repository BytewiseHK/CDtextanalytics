Office in Riyadh and plans for metal warehouse underscore HKEX’s role, Vanessa Lau says at Asian Financial Forum
Having acquired London Metal Exchange (LME) in 2012, HKEX is also exploring the possibility of building the first LME-accredited warehouse in Hong Kong. This would allow the physical exchange of metals such as aluminium and zinc between mainland China and the rest of the world. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, already has such a facility.
“A lot of new initiatives are happening, and we believe that both the Middle East and Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] will represent very strategic opportunities for Hong Kong and for the Hong Kong exchange,” Lau said.
Senior officials in Saudi Arabia have indicated that companies in the Middle East are interested in listing in Hong Kong to raise funds for infrastructure projects, Carlson Tong Ka-shing, HKEX chairman, said last year.
