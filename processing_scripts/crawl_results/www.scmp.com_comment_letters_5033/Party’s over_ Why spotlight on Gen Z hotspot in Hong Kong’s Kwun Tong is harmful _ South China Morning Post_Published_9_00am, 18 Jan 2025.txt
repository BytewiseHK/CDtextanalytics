Is Hong Kong’s Kwun Tong Promenade the ‘Lan Kwai Fong of Gen Z’?
A viral video about Hong Kong’s Kwun Tong Promenade becoming the “Lan Kwai Fong of Gen Z” on New Year’s Eve has cast the waterfront area in a negative light, with a social worker warning the backlash could chase teens away from public spaces altogether.
Young people the Post spoke to noted the promenade was a popular hang-out spot for people living in the district and they usually gathered with friends to chat and enjoy the city skyline, while the activities portrayed in the video were one-off.
They added that since the video went viral, their parents had shown concern and asked whether they frequented the area.
When the Post visited the Kwun Tong Promenade on a Saturday night, the waterfront was a lot quieter than depicted in the video by YouTuber EG Tsang Hin-man.
In his video filmed on New Year’s Eve, young people were seen offering free hugs and kisses to strangers.
His interviews with teenagers, some believed to be underage, discussed rumours about young people having sex in a public toilet at the promenade.
