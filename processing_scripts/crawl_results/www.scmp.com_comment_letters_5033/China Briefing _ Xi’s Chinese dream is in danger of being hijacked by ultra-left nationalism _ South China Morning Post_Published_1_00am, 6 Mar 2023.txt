Since its inception in 1921, China’s Communist Party has lurched between ultra-left radicalism and pragmatism, bringing about alternating tragedies and triumphs.
Deng’s successors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao have followed his doctrine by expanding the role of market forces while keeping a low profile for China on the international stage.
Jiang came up with his own phrase to summarise his style of governance,men sheng fa da cai(keeping quiet will help you make a fortune), while Hu’s is shorter –bu zhe teng(this has many meanings but usually, don’t flip-flop or don’t dither).
