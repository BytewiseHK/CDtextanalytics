The businessman says Malay employees tend to take leave very often, refuse to work overtime and have poor financial management
The man, whom online users said was a Chinese national and a business owner, complained in the video about the “life-changing experience” of hiring staff from Malaysia’s Malay-Muslim majority.
The one-minute video in Chinese, which went viral last week, painted the country’s Malay workers as uncommitted and who had taken leave so often that it was “out of your imagination”.
The unnamed entrepreneur also complained about the substandard work quality of the locals, their refusal to work overtime and their habit of asking for advance salary payments “due to poor financial management.”
“Lastly, for religious reasons every Friday they need to go mosque for prayers. Which means for the entire Friday afternoon he will be MIA,” the bespectacled businessman said in the video.
The video earned a swift condemnation from Malaysians who criticised the entrepreneur on social media for only focusing on growing his profit at the expense of his staff.
