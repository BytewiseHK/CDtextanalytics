Readers discuss how to bring in more high-performing individuals, the city’s own snooker champion, and complicity in illegal building alterations
Trump and O’Sullivan are not just athletes, they are also public figures with wide followings on social media. A post by one of them about an experience in Hong Kong – whether it is a hike along Dragon’s Back, dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant, or a shopping excursion to Causeway Bay – could bring the city’s unique charms to the attention of their fan bases. They could be ambassadors for Hong Kong tourism.
How do we invite more of these athletes to live in Hong Kong? The first step must be to let them experience what we have to offer. Hence, the government should focus its efforts on bringing in top players to take part in major local sporting events, from snooker, golf and tennis tournaments to horse races.
