Currently, Hong Kong does not have specific regulations governing the importation of pet food, even though most pet food in local stores is sourced internationally.
In view of our close contact with our pets, legislator Steven Ho Chun-yin has called on the government to strengthen its oversight to address any possible health concerns. As a dedicated owner of four beloved cats, I support the government to work with the Legislative Council and the Consumer Council on enacting a regulatory framework for imported pet food.
In addition to stepping up the monitoring of pet food, Hong Kong should address a glaring gap in its veterinary services – the lack of a definitive treatment protocol for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal viral infection that affects cats.
In recent years, an effective treatment has emerged in the form of GS-441524, an antiviral drug. Countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom acknowledge GS-441524 as a legitimate treatment for FIP and permit veterinarians to procure the drug legally. Hong Kong, however, has yet to legalise this treatment.
