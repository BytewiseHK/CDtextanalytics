Observatory says it received more than 10 reports of minor shaking, with duration of a few seconds
Hongkongers reported feeling the tremors of a magnitude 4.2 earthquake that struck about 200km (124 miles) southeast of the city on Friday afternoon, the Observatory said.
The forecaster said that it had received more than 10 locally felt reports of minor shaking, with a duration of a few seconds.
“Initial analysis from the Hong Kong Observatory indicated that an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 occurred at 2.40pm on Friday … south of Shanwei, Guangdong,” it said, adding its epicentre was about 200km southeast of Hong Kong.
“An initial estimate gave a local intensity of two on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, that is felt by people at rest, upper floors or favourably placed.”
Last November, some residents also reported experiencing minor shaking following a magnitude 4.7 earthquake in Taiwan.
