Show at main stadium on Saturday will feature Jay Fung, Cloud Wan, Jace Chan and local band Dear Jane, kicking off packed schedule for 2025
Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Sports Park will host its biggest crowd to date on Saturday, with 18,000 people expected at the main stadium’s first trial concert, ahead of a packed calendar of major events in the coming months.
Authorities said on Thursday that previous test events showed attendees did not all leave at once, as a significant number tended to stay behind afterwards to dine or shop. It was an observation that officials said would be considered in their planning for the concert to manage outgoing traffic flow.
“Every test event will be challenging because we are increasing both the scale and sophistication of individual events,” sports commissioner George Tsoi Kin-pan told a press briefing.
“This is the first non-sports event to be held in the main stadium … We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination among our different staff.”
The “FOUR in LOVE” charity concert on Saturday will feature singers Jay Fung Wan-him, Cloud Wan Ho-ying, Jace Chan Hoi-wing and local band Dear Jane.
Among the 18,000 expected to attend, around 4,000 will be situated at the stadium’s lawn area to simulate the arrangements of coming major shows.
