Over the past few months, I’ve become an expert in making wontons, among other Chinese dishes. It was rather serendipitous that I discovered the Mid-Hudson Chinese Language Centre here in upstate New York, roughly 120km (75 miles) north of New York City, in a place where most of the population is white. The language centre also offers cooking and art classes, such as lantern making and traditional drumming.
The classes attracted retirees, Chinese cuisine enthusiasts, and the spouses of Chinese and Chinese-Americans who wanted to learn conversational Mandarin. It pulled in American-born Chinese like myself who were desperate not to relinquish our already limited vocabulary and connection with our roots. The centre was an unofficial hub for parents who did not want their children to lose their link to their family history.
The diversity of the student body – multigenerational and multi-ethnic – speaks volumes about the strong interest in Chinese culture.
To be sure, the network of Chinese language schools across the country plays a critical role in cultural preservation. The Chinese School Association in the United States has more than 300 member schools across 41 states.
These schools help preserve the heritage passed down by our ancestors – rituals, music, festivals, recipes, language – giving us a chance to celebrate our past and tap into our personal histories.
