Hong Kong advocate also asking families from city if they want to go to Thailand to search for loved ones, following lead of mainlanders
Sun Maoxing and wife Wang Weiju, both in their sixties, never expected their first trip outside China to involve a desperate search for their missing son.
The couple from mainland China’s Shandong province on Monday stood outside the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, pleading for help from anyone they could see leaving the site.
Each of the parents told embassy staff to “please save my son”.
“The last time I saw my son was April last year, when my mother died … I did not have a chance to talk to him much then,” Sun, 64, said.
His 60-year-old wife, Wang, was equally distraught. “He is our only son. We cannot live without him,” she said outside the embassy.
The exact location of their 32-year-old son Sun Baochao is currently unknown, with WeChat messages asking his parents for money their only recent communication. In a message last week he revealed he was in Thailand.
