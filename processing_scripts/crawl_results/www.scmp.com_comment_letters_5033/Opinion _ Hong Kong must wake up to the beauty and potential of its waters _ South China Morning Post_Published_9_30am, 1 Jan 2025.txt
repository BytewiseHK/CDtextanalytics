Well planned development of marine recreation can improve residents’ quality of life, promote sustainability and boost tourism
Hong Kong, renowned for its stunning skyline and vibrant urban life, also boasts an extensive coastline and many underused islands.
As the city grapples with the challenges of population density and limited land resources, it is imperative to explore better uses of our water bodies, particularly for marine recreation and ecotourism. By investing in this sector, we can enhance residents’ quality of life, stimulate economic growth and promote sustainable practices.
