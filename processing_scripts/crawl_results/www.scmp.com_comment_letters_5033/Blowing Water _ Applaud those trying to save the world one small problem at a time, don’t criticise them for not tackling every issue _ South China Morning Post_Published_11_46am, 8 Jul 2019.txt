In my previous column I condemned the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival. The festival slaughters up to 100,000 dogs over a 10-day period every year. Most of the animals are stolen pets, and this festival is falsely promoted as a tradition to satisfy a misconception that dog meat is a health tonic.
Response from readers was overwhelmingly supportive to the idea this inhumane practice must be stopped, and the Chinese government should classify dogs as companion animals to give them better protection.
However, some readers expanded the argument and suggested cows, pigs, horses, chickens, and other animals should not be treated any less humanely than dogs and should also be given the same protection.
Some went further still, and accused dog lovers of being hypocritical, because they believe pigs and cows to be smarter than canines, but people seem fine with eating them.
It just goes to show not everyone considers the same things to be urgent or a major problem.
