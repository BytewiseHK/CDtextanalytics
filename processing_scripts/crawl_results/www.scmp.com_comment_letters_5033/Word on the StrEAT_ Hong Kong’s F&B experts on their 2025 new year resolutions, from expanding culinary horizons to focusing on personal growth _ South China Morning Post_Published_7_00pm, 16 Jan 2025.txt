Maintaining a healthier work-life balance, taking a break from social media and keeping an eye on the small steps to success are among the goals for the new year
“Opening Bourke’s has been a fun journey in hard work, less sleep and a sprinkle of daily stress. There has been so much going on in my mind, the dishes I dreamed of creating got sidetracked, so I aim to keep my creativity going while maintaining balance, and remember in the thick of things that it’s just ‘food’.
“Growth takes time, especially when you’re learning new skills and climbing up the professional ladder. If anyone had told me last year that I would be crafting my own menu as a head chef for the first time, I wouldn’t have believed it. I had hoped my next career step would be a new opening, and I ended up getting the best case scenario – doing it with my friends.
“Prioritisation is very important when achieving goals. There’s always going to be a million things to do, and the best way to tackle them all is to take it one step at a time. Cross things off a list, tick all your boxes, do everything to 100 per cent.”
