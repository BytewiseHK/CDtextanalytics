During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit with China.
At its peak at the end of 2019, the US had imposed tariffs on more than US$360 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China had retaliated with US$110 billion worth of import duties on US products.
As part of the deal, China agreed to buy an additional US$200 billion worth of American goods and services over the following two years, compared with 2017 levels.
