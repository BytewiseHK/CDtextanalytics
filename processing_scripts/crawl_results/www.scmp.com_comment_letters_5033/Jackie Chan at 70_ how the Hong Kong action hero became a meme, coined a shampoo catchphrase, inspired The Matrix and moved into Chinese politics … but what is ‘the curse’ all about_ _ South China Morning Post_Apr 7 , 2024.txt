In recent years, his prolific film career has slowed as he’s turned more selective. He’s also taken to the political circuit and expressed interest in joining the Chinese Communist Party.
To celebrate his 70th birthday today, April 7, we look at how Jackie Chan influenced culture, both on and off the silver screens, and where the legend is at today.
Anyone who’s spent time online will have come across many memes featuring Chan with both hands up next to his head, seemingly expressing confusion and disbelief. However, for audiences at home, the meme that often first comes to mind is him next to a bottle of shampoo from his appearance in a television commercial for Chinese-made brand Bawang. In the television spot, Chan delivers a monologue about why he was suspicious of the claims of the shampoo and how, upon trying it, he discovered his hair becoming darker, shiner and softer. Famously, he described the new-found bounce of his locks phonetically as “duang”, solidifying that particular snippet in the ad forever in memeland.
Bawang company suffered significant losses in 2018, taking a hit like various other brands the actor vouched for, including Hong Kong Airlines, California Fitness and the Volkswagen Caddy. This led netizens to proclaim the phenomenon of the “Jackie Chan curse”.
