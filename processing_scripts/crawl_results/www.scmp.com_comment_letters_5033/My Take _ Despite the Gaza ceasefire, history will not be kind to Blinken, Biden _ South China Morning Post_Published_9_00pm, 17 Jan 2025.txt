In the annals of Western genocide, the US secretary of state and his boss deserve much more than a footnote for providing Israel with weapons
Soon-to-be ex-US secretary of state Antony Blinken has cried a river with his crocodile tears for Gazans who have been slaughtered like lambs by the Israeli army supplied with a constant stream of American weapons.
In what is the last act of the administration for Israel, he has told US Congress that US$8 billion in arms sales have been approved, thus bringing the total to more than US$20 billion since the Palestinian genocide began more than a year ago.
As one political comedian has put it, the Joe Biden administration is like someone who keeps telling a mass shooter in a shopping centre to stop while making sure he never runs out of ammunition to “finish the job”.
When the full history of Western genocides is written, I strongly believe Blinken, not just Biden, will have earned more than a footnote in it. So much for the man who has tirelessly sung the praises of democracy, human rights and the rules-based international system.
All the arms sales have been put to horrific use, according to several decent State Department officials who have resigned over Gaza.
As told in CBS News’ 60 Minutes, former United States diplomat Hala Rharrit said she documented images coming out of Gaza of “fragments of US bombs next to massacres of mostly children”.
