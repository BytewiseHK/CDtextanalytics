The good news of less waste generated is tempered by the lack of clarity on plastic waste statistics and officials’ mistaken faith in incineration as a solution
One positive finding is that the quantity of municipal solid waste going to landfill has fallen – by 2.2 per cent to a daily average of 10,884 tonnes, from 11,128 tonnes in 2022. Easing the pressure to expand Hong Kong’s landfill capacity is one of the government’s main waste management objectives.
On a daily average, the quantity of solid waste we threw away last year fell by 10.5 per cent for plastics, 3.2 per cent for paper and 3.4 per cent for food. But given that food makes up the largest part of solid waste at nearly a third, we still need to urgently find ways to handle the 3,191 tonnes of food discarded every day. Hong Kong’s existing food waste treatment facilities can only handle 600 tonnes a day.
Households have done well in cutting their food waste, which went down by 291 tonnes a day last year – but the same went up by 179 tonnes for the commercial sector. Clearly, the authorities need to put in more effort and resources to help businesses slash their food waste.
