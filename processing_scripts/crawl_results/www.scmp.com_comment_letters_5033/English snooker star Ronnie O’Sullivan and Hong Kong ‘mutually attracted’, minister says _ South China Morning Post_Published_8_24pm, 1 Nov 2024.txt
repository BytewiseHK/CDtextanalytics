Labour chief Chris Sun says he understands director of immigration used personal ties to facilitate seven-times world champion’s move to city
O’Sullivan took up residency through the “achievement” route of the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS), saying he had considered making the move in the “last five or six years”.
Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun Yuk-han said he understood that Director of Immigration Benson Kwok Joon-fung used his personal ties to facilitate the seven-times world champion’s move.
The minister said Kwok, who appeared in a promotional video alongside O’Sullivan, was a regular snooker player.
“My way of describing it is that we are mutually attracted to each other,” Sun said at a talent policy briefing. “He thinks Hong Kong is very attractive, and we think he is great.
“We are happy to have such a top player. The most important thing is that he sees the attractions of Hong Kong.”
The city’s tax regime, lifestyle and proximity to mainland China were among the reasons cited by the snooker player in making his choice for a second home.
