Rather than fighting court battles, the government should put in place comprehensive legislation upholding the LGBTQ community’s rights
The right to equal treatment and to live with dignity lie at the heart of any fair society. Those two principles were among the first featured in the groundbreaking Universal Declaration of Human Rights which marked its 75th anniversary last week.
Members of Hong Kong’s LGBTQ community, however, face a wide range of discriminatory policies.
Change is long overdue.
The courts have gradually removed one such practice after another in a series of landmark cases over the last 11 years.
In the latest, the Court of Final Appeal last month ruled in favour of equal access to public housing and inheritance rights for same-sex couples married overseas.
These cases followed a familiar pattern. The Housing Authority and the secretary for justice sought to uphold practices which discriminate. They were undeterred by defeats in lower courts.
