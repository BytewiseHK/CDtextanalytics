Carrie Lam says Hong Kong failures have led to crisis
Surely not the days before the pandemic or the protests? The city may have seemed comparatively less troubled back then, but that was when its problems, such as the widening wealth gap, galloping property prices and increasing confrontation between the executive and legislature, were all swept under the carpet.
The uncomfortable truth is, Hong Kong was already sick back then, and it cannot return to the previous status quo – it needs a new way out.
A patient would be fortunate to get a good doctor to accurately diagnose any disease and prescribe proper treatment for a cure. Similarly, that is what a city in troubled waters needs – a visionary leader to set the right course and steer the boat out of the storm. That may be common sense, but it’s easier said than done.
