‘We are optimistic,’ tourism official says as Shanghai reportedly enters talks to bring American pop superstar to China
Zhang Qi, deputy director of Shanghai’s culture and tourism bureau, said local officials had hosted Swift’s team for preliminary discussions in the municipality, Shanghai-based media outlet The Paper reported on Tuesday.
“As for whether it will ultimately happen, it depends on the market and the attractiveness of our city. However, we are optimistic and think that there may be hope for this year,” he said.
The counsellors’ office of the Shanghai municipal government said on its social media account last year that government departments should streamline approvals, visas, customs and other logistical challenges that limited the potential to attract top-tier talent.
