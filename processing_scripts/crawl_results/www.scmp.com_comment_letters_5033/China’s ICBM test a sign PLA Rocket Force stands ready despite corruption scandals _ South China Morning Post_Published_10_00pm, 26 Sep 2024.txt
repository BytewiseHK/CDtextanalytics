China’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test shows its missile capabilities and the combat readiness of its rocket force despite a recent corruption scandal, according to analysts.
The missile fell near French Polynesia’s exclusive economic zone near the Marquesas Islands, according to Agence France-Presse, citing French Polynesian President Moetai Brotherson.
The missile launch comes a week before National Day on October 1, when the People’s Republic of China will celebrate its 75th anniversary.
