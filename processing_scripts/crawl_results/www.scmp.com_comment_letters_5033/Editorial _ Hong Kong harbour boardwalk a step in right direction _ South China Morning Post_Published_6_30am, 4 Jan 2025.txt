Feature due to open by Lunar New Year is first phase in project that will provide recreation and enjoyment for Hong Kong public
The deepwater harbour of Hong Kong remains one of the world’s most magnificent. Preservation and conservation are paramount.
But for all its natural beauty, and renown as a tourist attraction, residents and visitors lack unrestricted access to its waters. The government is spending billions to strike a better balance with development through a harbourfront enhancement programme.
A 1.1km (0.7 mile) western section of a long-awaited harbourfront boardwalk, built beneath the elevated Island Eastern Corridor on Hong Kong Island, is set to open to the public by Lunar New Year. It will offer views of Kowloon unhindered by concrete or metal barriers.
Eventually, it could become part of an envisaged 13km pedestrian-friendly promenade connecting Kennedy Town in the west to Shau Kei Wan in the east.
In a Facebook post, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho hailed it as “the first seaside boardwalk built under an operating main road”.
