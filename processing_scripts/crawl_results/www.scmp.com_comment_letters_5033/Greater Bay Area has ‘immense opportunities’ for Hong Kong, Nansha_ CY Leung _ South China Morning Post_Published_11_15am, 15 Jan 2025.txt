Hong Kong deputy financial secretary Michael Wong and Nansha district party chief Liu Wei are among conference’s VIP speakers
Hong Kong and Nansha district can find “immense opportunities” at the intersection of global innovation and regional integration of the Greater Bay Area, a former chief executive has said, highlighting the city’s role as a superconnector in the region.
The China Conference: Greater Bay Area 2025 was held in the district, making the South China Morning Post the first Hong Kong media company to organise a bay area forum in one of the mainland Chinese cities under the central authorities’ development blueprint.
Hong Kong’s deputy financial secretary, Michael Wong Wai-lun, and Nansha district party chief Liu Wei were among the VIP speakers at the one-day conference, which attracted about 300 attendees, with around two-thirds of them from outside the mainland.
Among the attendees were consuls general and deputy consuls from eight countries – Australia, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey.
Leung, a vice-chairman of the country’s top political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said the bay area development blueprint offered a “much bigger and more diverse playing field” for Hong Kong, increasing the financial hub’s geographical and sectoral diversification.
