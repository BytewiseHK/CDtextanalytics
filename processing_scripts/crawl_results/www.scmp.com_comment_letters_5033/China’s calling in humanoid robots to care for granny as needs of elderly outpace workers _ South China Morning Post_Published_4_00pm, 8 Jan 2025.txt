To address its rapidly ageing population, China is among the first nations to set policy plans for humanoid robots that will provide companionship, monitor health and may even resemble loved ones
In the near future, China’s rapidly ageing population could find that much care in their twilight years comes from humanoid robots, under new top-level policy plans aimed at tackling the nation’s mounting demographic challenges.
Authorities intend to boost the research and development of such robots, as well as brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence, to support elderly care across the country, the State Council said in a directive issued on Tuesday, making China among the first countries to formalise such a policy on the use of robotics.
Emphasising the acceleration of technology and digitisation in this sector, the nation’s cabinet vowed to establish major national science and technology projects with a focus on the aforementioned areas.
The initiative is part of a comprehensive strategy to strengthen support for elderly citizens in China, one of the world’s fastest-ageing countries, alongside other measures such as encouraging foreign investment and training more professionals that the country faces an acute shortage of.
The document pledged that China will “basically establish” a nationwide elderly care service network by 2029, and by 2035 it will ensure that all senior citizens have access to basic services under a “mature” care system tailored to the country’s unique needs.
There were 216.76 million people aged 65 and above in China by the end of 2023, accounting for 15.4 per cent of the total population. In contrast, by the end of 2023, there were merely 8.2 million beds for elderly care services nationwide, according to official figures.
