Just as border tensions seemed to be easing, the Yarlung Tsangpo River project raises new questions between the two countries
Such concerns were not unreasonable, given the sheer scale of the project – at more than three times the size of the Three Gorges Dam.
China’s damming of Tibetan rivers has long been a source of tension between the Asian giants, along with repeated disputes over their Himalayan border.
Those long-standing strains had started to ease late last year, with Beijing and New Delhi signing an agreement to de-escalate border tensions and the leaders of the two countries having a rare meeting – all within the same week in October.
Relations appeared to improve further on December 17, when Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that one of Beijing’s diplomatic priorities for 2025 was to improve ties with New Delhi.
