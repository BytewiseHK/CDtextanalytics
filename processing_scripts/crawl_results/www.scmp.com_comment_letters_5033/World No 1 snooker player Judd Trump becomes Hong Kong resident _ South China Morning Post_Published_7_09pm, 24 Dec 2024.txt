The move was announced by Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE), the government office tasked with attracting talent.
“I am here because I enjoy the city, I love everything about Hong Kong – the food, the people and the buildings,” Trump, 35, said in a video released by HKTE on social media.
“It is inspiring for me to be here.”
