The two leaders spoke just before the US Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban the popular Chinese-owned app as soon as Sunday.
On his Truth Social account on Friday, Trump posted that he and Xi had “just” had a call and that it was a “very good one” for both China and the US, adding the two “will do everything possible to make the world more peaceful and safe”.
“It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing trade, fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects,” Trump said in his note, which posted at 9.28am ET, just after China’s state news agency Xinhua said Xi had spoken with Trump on the phone.
The Supreme Court ruling was issued at 10am.
According to Xinhua, Xi said he and Trump “attach great importance to mutual interactions” and “hope for a good start of the China-US relationship” during Trump’s second term.
China and the US could be “good friends and partners”, Xi added.
