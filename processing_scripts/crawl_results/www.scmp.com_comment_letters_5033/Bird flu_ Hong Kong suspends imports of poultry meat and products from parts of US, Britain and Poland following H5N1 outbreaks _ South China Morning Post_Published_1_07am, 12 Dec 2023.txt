The Centre for Food Safety said on Monday that it had instructed traders to suspend the import of poultry meat and products, including eggs, from the relevant areas with immediate effect to protect public health.
It said it had been notified by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in areas of the US, the United Kingdom and Poland.
The suspension of US products covers Stanislaus and San Benito counties in California, Barron County in Wisconsin, Arkansas’ Johnson County, Ohio’s Darke County and Bent County in Colorado.
East Devon in Britain and the Goleniowski district of the Zachodniopomorskie region of Poland are also affected.
“The centre has contacted the Polish, British and American authorities over the issues and will closely monitor information issued by the WOAH and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreaks,” a spokesman said.
“Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation.”
Hong Kong imported about 21,470 tonnes of chilled and frozen poultry meat and 57.1 million eggs from the US in the first nine months of this year.
