Golden Globes and Oscar nominee All We Imagine as Light has shown an Indian art-house film can challenge Bollywood’s dominance of cinemas
While Indian cinema is best known for Bollywood extravaganzas, it is an art-house film about three women navigating loneliness and love in a metropolis that is gaining viewers and earning international recognition.
It is also the first Indian film to be nominated in the best director category at the Golden Globes, which will be presented on January 5, as well as in the best picture category for non-English movies.
For director Payal Kapadia, the response to her debut film in her home country is an added bonus to the accolades it has earned abroad.
“It’s very difficult for independent films to get screens in India. I am very happy with the response. Now I want to show the film in places in the country where it has not been shown so far, the smaller cities,” Kapadia said in an interview.
