Recent discoveries are significant, but experts say city needs more resources, talent to deal with them
Hongkongers have been enthralled in recent weeks by the news that dinosaur fossils have been found on a remote island.
First came the belated announcement, in October, that a set of fossils discovered on Port Island in 2013 had been confirmed to be from dinosaurs.
Then, expert investigators who headed for the island off the northeastern part of Hong Kong found about 30 more rocks with fossils.
The island is in one of several protected zones off Sai Kung, in the Unesco Global Geopark, a showcase of dramatic ancient rock formations that tell the story of Hong Kong’s rich and varied geological past.
Experts believe the fossils found there could date to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago.
The recent online buzz over fossils and dinosaurs had more than 100 people saying they were keen to join a group tour to the site.
“Wow, Hong Kong really has its own dinosaur fossils! We are so happy and excited!” gushed one social media user.
