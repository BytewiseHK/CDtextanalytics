Tourist tells local media she mistakenly stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake
A Hong Kong tourist in Japan reportedly rammed the car she was driving into a noodle shop on Saturday, injuring a customer, after mistaking the accelerator for the brake pedal.
The woman was trying to park in front of a soba shop in the city of Izu in Shizuoka prefecture when her vehicle ploughed into the establishment instead, shattering glass and hitting columns, local media reported.
She said she had mistakenly stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake.
At around 1.30pm on Saturday, a shop employee reported to the local authorities that a car had crashed into the restaurant, blocking the entrance and exit.
The injured customer, in her 40s, was leaving the shop at the time. She was taken to hospital suffering from leg injuries.
Local police are investigating the case.
According to Japanese tourist authorities, Shizuoka prefecture, home to Mount Fuji, is a popular urbanite destination situated midway between Tokyo and Nagoya, away from the hustle and bustle of the cities.
