Researchers urge government to take note of poll as deadline for devising official legal framework for same-sex partnerships nears
A university study has found 70 per cent of Hongkongers in stable same-sex relationships want to marry their partners, as academics behind the poll urge authorities to take note of the data in devising a framework for legal recognition of the unions.
Researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which published the results of the poll on Monday, said many couples wanted to get married as they were worried about their rights and how the legal status of their relationships would be viewed in places such as hospitals.
Among the 908 LGBTQ people surveyed between May and August 2023, 47.2 per cent said they were in a committed relationship. Within that group, 70 per cent said they wished to marry their partners.
“This shows that marriage is a very important institution for LGBTQ respondents in Hong Kong,” Suen said.
