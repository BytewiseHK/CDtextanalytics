A 27-year-old crashed his motorbike when a passer-by stood in the way in an apparent attempt to prevent escape
A Hong Kong motorcyclist fleeing from police has died in a crash after a man appeared to stop his escape by standing in the vehicle’s pathway, sparking a heated debate over whether the bystander’s action was appropriate.
The Customs and Excise Department confirmed on Saturday that the man who tried to interfere in the traffic incident the day before was an off-duty staff member.
The crash occurred at around 5.46pm on Friday when a motorcycle driven by a 27-year-old man surnamed Wong was travelling along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street in Ngau Tau Kok, according to police.
“Upon approaching Central Mail Centre, the motorcycle reportedly went out of control and rammed into a roadside iron pole,” it said.
Police said the motorcyclist sustained multiple serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
In dashcam footage of the incident circulating online, a man in grey clothing is seen jumping left and right in the middle of the road as if he is trying to stop a motorbike that is speeding towards him.
