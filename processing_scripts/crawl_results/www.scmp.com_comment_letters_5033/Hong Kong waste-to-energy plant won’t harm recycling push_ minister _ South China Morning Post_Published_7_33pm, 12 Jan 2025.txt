Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan pushes back against ‘misunderstandings’ over facility opening this year
Hong Kong has not given up on promoting recycling and reducing rubbish, the environment minister has said, while touting the benefits of an inaugural waste-to-energy plant set to launch this year.
Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Sunday the facility located on an island off Lantau would help ease the burden on strained resources and advance sustainability goals.
“The commissioning of I·PARK1 marks a significant milestone in Hong Kong’s journey towards sustainable waste management,” Tse said.
“This state-of-the-art facility will not only reduce our reliance on landfills but also contribute to our renewable energy goals.”
Tse said the plant would incinerate rubbish and convert the heat into electricity, with the use of the technology able to help reduce the space taken up by landfill sites. He called the move “an absolute necessity in Hong Kong where land resources are expensive”.
Greenhouse gas emissions would be lower than those from landfills, he said. The plant also provided a sustainable source of energy to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels.
