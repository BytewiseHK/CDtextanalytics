Latest discussions come days after the Philippines accused China of encroaching on its exclusive economic zone near Scarborough Shoal
China said both sides had “agreed to strengthen dialogue and contact on maritime issues and properly handle maritime disputes”, following a meeting between Chen Xiaodong, the vice-minister for foreign affairs, and his Philippine counterpart Maria Theresa Lazaro in the Chinese city of Xiamen on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Lazaro expressed “serious concern” about the presence of Chinese coastguard vessels in the Philippine exclusive economic zone but expressed a willingness to seek common ground, according to Bloomberg.
The talks, the first of their kind since July, were held under a mechanism to discuss their territorial disputes and were attended by military and coastguard representatives.
They follow a series of clashes between the two countries’ coastguards over the past year around disputed South China Sea features.
