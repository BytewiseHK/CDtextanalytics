Rules include tougher standards to ensure software is more secure and bolster sanction authority against likes of Beijing
The new rules included tougher standards to ensure that software is more secure and demand more rigorous verification and evaluation procedures, according to Anne Neuberger, cyber and emerging technology deputy at the National Security Council.
“We’ve spent the last seven months carefully reviewing each hacking incident to check exactly how the Chinese, other governments and criminals got through the gates,” Neuberger said.
“If an entity is conducting disruptive attacks against critical infrastructure, we will come after them. We can sanction them and use that tool, particularly around the world.”
