Sunac and Shimao have received new liquidation petitions, while Country Garden and Times China face court hearings this month
There is no end in sight for the woes of indebted Chinese developers, which continue to face winding-up hearings and receive fresh liquidation petitions in Hong Kong that will decide their fate.
Sunac China Holdings and Shimao Group Holdings received new liquidation petitions on Friday, while Country Garden Holdings and Times China Holdings face court hearings later this month.
Meanwhile, Tianji Holding, a Hong Kong-incorporated unit of China Evergrande Group, got an eight-week reprieve after a Hong Kong judge on Wednesday adjourned a winding-up hearing to March 12.
Edward Middleton and Tiffany Wong of Alvarez & Marsal Asia, the liquidators for Evergrande, filed the petition against Tianji in November.
