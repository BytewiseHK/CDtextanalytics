Man allegedly tried to rob woman who fiercely resisted, with her struggle drawing the attention of nearby pedestrians
Pedestrians subdued a man in Hong Kong after he allegedly tried to rob a woman in the busy Mong Kok shopping district on Tuesday, with police officers finding 21 fake banknotes in his underpants.
The incident took place at about 1.50pm on Nathan Road just after the 64-year-old woman had withdrawn HK$20,000 (US$2,600) in cash from an ATM.
As she walked near the junction with Argyle Street, a man suddenly snatched her bag from behind.
The woman fiercely resisted, with her struggle drawing the attention of nearby pedestrians.
Two bystanders, including an off-duty officer, quickly intervened, overpowering the man and restraining him until police arrived and detained him.
