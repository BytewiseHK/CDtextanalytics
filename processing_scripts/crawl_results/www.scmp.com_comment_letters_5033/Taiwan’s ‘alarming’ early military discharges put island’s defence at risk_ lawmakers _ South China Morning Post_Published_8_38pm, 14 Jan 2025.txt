Legislators call for action as defence ministry figures show a rising number of volunteer personnel are willing to pay for early discharges
In 2020, 401 personnel applied for early discharge, having agreed to pay the fees to leave. Last year, that figure rocketed to 1,565 personnel, according to figures obtained through a legislative query submitted to the island’s cabinet last week.
Taiwan’s volunteer soldiers are expected to be the main fighting force in a conflict because they receive more extensive training compared to the mandatory military service force, which has a set service duration of one year.
Wan Mei-ling, a legislator from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, called the trend “alarming”.
