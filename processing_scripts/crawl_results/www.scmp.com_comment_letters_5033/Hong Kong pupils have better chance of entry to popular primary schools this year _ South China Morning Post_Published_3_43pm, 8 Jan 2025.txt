There are fewer applicants and an average 13 per cent more Primary One vacancies across districts in central allocation phase this year
Pupils applying for Primary One spots will have a higher chance of being admitted to popular subsidised schools in Hong Kong this year, as new statistics show an average 13 per cent increase in vacancies in such institutions.
Parents of around 21, 000 children have to pick schools starting from next Monday, when the central allocation phase starts. The increase in vacancies has been attributed largely to fewer pupils using the “siblings route” to secure spots in the first stage of admissions, and fewer applicants overall.
One popular government school in Tsuen Wan had 80 per cent more vacancies than last year through central allocation, a process commonly dubbed the “lucky draw”.
The Education Bureau on Wednesday announced the number of spots still available at public primary schools in the central allocation stage. Around half of all final-year preschool pupils received offers from government and aided primary schools during the discretionary phase last November.
“Children who have joined the Primary One admission system for 2025 but have not yet secured a discretionary place can take part in the central allocation … Parents concerned should make their choice of schools within the period from January 13 to 19,” the bureau said on Monday, adding results would be announced on June 4.
Schools must accept applications from the siblings of current pupils in the discretionary phase, and have to use the spots in the central allocation stage if the quota for sibling admissions is used up.
