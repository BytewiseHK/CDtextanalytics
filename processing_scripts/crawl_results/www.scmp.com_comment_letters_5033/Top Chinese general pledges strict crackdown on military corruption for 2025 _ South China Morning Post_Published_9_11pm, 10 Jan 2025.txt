General He Weidong hails progress and calls on PLA to ‘punish evil’ as President Xi Jinping’s anti-graft crusade intensifies
However, He added that the armed forces must deepen political training, strengthen political supervision, strictly crack down on corruption and “punish evil”.
He said the armed forces must “deepen the rectification and governance in the industry” and continue to “purify the political ecology”.
The remarks were part of He’s address on Friday to a meeting of the CMC’s Commission for Discipline Inspection, the PLA’s anti-corruption body.
The CMC is the body in charge of China’s armed forces and is chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
