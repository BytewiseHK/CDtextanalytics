TikTok, the popular short-form video platform owned by China’s ByteDance, is facing a potential ban in the United States. Although TikTok might dodge an immediate bullet as US president-elect Donald Trump has indicated that the app is worth saving, internet traffic data shows that users are already flocking to alternatives.
At the same time, the new “immigrants”, who have identified themselves as TikTok “refugees” in their first posts on RedNote, are getting a warm welcome from Chinese users who are leaving comments in English.
Although it is unclear why the US move to ban TikTok is driving so many foreign users to RedNote, this unexpected development provides a precious opportunity for Chinese and foreign social media users to interact.
