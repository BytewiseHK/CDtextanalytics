Ministry of Commerce urges Washington to ‘stop blaming China for US domestic industrial-development problems’
China has rejected the findings of a US investigation into its shipbuilding industry and described the allegations that it levelled at China as an attempt to hinder the country’s development.
Section 301 investigations aim to determine whether a foreign government’s policies or acts are discriminatory, and whether they burden or restrict US commerce.
“The US 301 investigation is driven by domestic political purposes and the goal of curbing China’s development, posing a significant threat to the multilateral trade system and international trade rules,” the ministry said.
US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said Beijing’s targeted dominance in the three sectors was “the greatest barrier to revitalisation of US industries”.
“Today, the US ranks 19th in the world in commercial shipbuilding, and we build less than five ships each year, while the PRC [People’s Republic of China] is building more than 1,700 ships,” she said. “In 1975, the United States ranked No 1, and we were building more than 70 ships a year.”
