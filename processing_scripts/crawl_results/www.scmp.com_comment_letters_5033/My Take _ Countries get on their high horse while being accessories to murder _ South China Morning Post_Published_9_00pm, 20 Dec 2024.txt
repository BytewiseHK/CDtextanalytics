As the world’s most respected human rights groups warn against the continuing Palestinian genocide, the US and Canada penalise China
Earlier this month, Amnesty International issued a damning report on Israel’s total war on the people of Gaza. The 296-page report is titled, “‘You Feel Like You Are Subhuman’: Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza”.
It was followed by Human Rights Watch (HRW), which has also published its own damning 179-page report, “Israel’s Crime of Extermination, Acts of Genocide in Gaza”.
So, what do Canada and the United States do? Impose more sanctions, of course – against China over Xinjiang. That’s chutzpah!
The US Department of Homeland Security has added 29 more Chinese companies to its so-called entity list under the Uygur Forced Labour Prevention Act, bringing the total number to 107.
Meanwhile, the US has been suing Spain, a Nato ally. Since it has been arming and enabling Israel’s wars in Gaza and across the Middle East, naturally, it is unhappy that Madrid has been blocking shipments carrying US arms to Israel from entering its ports.
So Washington has lodged its case with the Federal Maritime Commission – a supposedly independent US government agency that regulates international shipping and can levy astronomical fines – for alleged violation of maritime trade regulations! In other words, the US is suing Spain for upholding its own humanitarian policy and enforcing international law and norms against genocide.
