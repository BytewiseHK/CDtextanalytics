Security Bureau says Immigration Department followed up on case and ‘it is understood that the person has returned to Hong Kong’
A 24-year-old Hong Kong woman suspected to have been abducted in Southeast Asia has returned to the city, the Security Bureau has said, as it warned about overseas job scams on its website.
The bureau’s remarks on the case on Saturday followed widely circulated claims on an online forum the previous day that a 24-year-old Hongkonger had been brought to and detained in Myanmar after arriving in Thailand last month.
The bureau said the Immigration Department had followed up on the matter via the Chinese foreign ministry’s arm in Hong Kong and the country’s embassy in the area.
“The department has provided appropriate advice and all feasible measures according to the family’s wishes. It is understood that the person has returned to Hong Kong,” a bureau spokesman said.
On the bureau’s website, the outbound travel alerts section on overseas job scams noted there were recent incidents involving Hongkongers suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, and detained to engage in illegal work.
