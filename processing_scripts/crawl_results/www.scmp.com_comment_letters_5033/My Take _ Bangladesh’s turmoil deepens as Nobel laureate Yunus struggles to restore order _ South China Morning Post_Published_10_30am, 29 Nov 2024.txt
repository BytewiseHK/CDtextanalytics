Muhammad Yunus faces challenges in restoring order and reviving Bangladesh’s economy amid ethnic tensions and urgent calls for new elections
However, recent developments have dashed these hopes, and Dhaka now risks descending into renewed violence.
Prominent Hindu leader Krishna Das Prabhu, who has been organising rallies to demand security for the minority community, was detained this month on charges of sedition. Clashes erupted between Hindu protesters and police, as well as factions of the Muslim majority, resulting in one lawyer’s death and numerous injuries.
The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle. However, the interim government clearly needs to deliver on its primary mandate: restoring law and order and preparing for fresh elections to establish the next government.
