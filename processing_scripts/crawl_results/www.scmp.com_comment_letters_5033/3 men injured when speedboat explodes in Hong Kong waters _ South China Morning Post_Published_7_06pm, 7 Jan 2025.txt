Hongkonger and mainland Chinese victim are in critical condition, while a second mainlander is listed as serious after boat explodes in waters off Tuen Mun
Three men about to head out to sea for a fishing trip were injured when their speedboat exploded in waters off Tuen Mun in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening, with two of them in a critical condition.
Fuel leaked from a worn-out pipe on the boat, triggering the blast, police said.
The incident occurred shortly before 6pm at Castle Peak Bay near the Castle Peak Fish Wholesale Market on Wu Shan Road.
Authorities received reports a boat exploded and flames were erupting from the vessel.
One man was a 48-year-old Hongkonger and the other victims were two-way permit holders from mainland China, aged 29 and 40.
They were taken to Tuen Mun Hospital for treatment.
