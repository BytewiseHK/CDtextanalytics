Hong Kong has an ageing population, a low birth rate and many retirees are financially unprepared for the future, experts say
“The subscription of pension life insurance products in Hong Kong [is] actually very small,” Tang said.
OECD estimates show that retiring individuals reaching the age of 65 want to have at least 70 per cent of their previous year’s income to maintain a comparable quality of life, Tang said.
At the same time, Hong Kong’s healthcare system is under strain because of an ageing population and the departure of medical professionals.
People aged 65 and older accounted for about 22 per cent of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million population in 2023, according to the Statistics Department. By 2046, they are projected to make up around 36 per cent of the total population.
