Stock price of the world’s largest contract chipmaker has leapt despite uncertainty posed by Donald Trump
The world’s largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, posted a 57 per cent jump in net income to T$374.68 billion (US$11.4 billion) for the quarter ended December 31, a record high for any quarter and in line with estimates. Revenue for the quarter climbed 39 per cent from the same period a year earlier.
It expected similar revenue growth in the current quarter of 37 per cent.
TSMC also said it expected its capital spending for this year to be between US$38 billion and US$42 billion, an increase of as much as 41 per cent, maintaining its bullish outlook for AI demand.
The Taiwanese company, however, faces headwinds from US government’s technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about president-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs.
