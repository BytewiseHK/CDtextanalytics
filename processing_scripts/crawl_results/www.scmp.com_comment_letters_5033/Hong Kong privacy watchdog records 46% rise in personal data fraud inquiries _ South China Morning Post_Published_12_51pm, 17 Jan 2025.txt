Privacy commissioner urges public against giving away personal information, says scammers need private data to lure victims to scam farms
Hong Kong’s privacy watchdog last year received 46 per cent more inquiries related to suspected personal data fraud compared with 2023, its commissioner has said, while warning against scams intended to lure victims into illegal work overseas.
Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling said on Friday that her office recorded 1,158 such inquiries last year, an increase from the 793 logged in 2023.
“To trick victims into going overseas for illegal activities would involve getting their personal data. One must be more vigilant and not give away personal information and that of your family to fraudsters,” she said.
“Once you’ve given some information, there will be ways to further scam you,” she said, adding that such data could include bank account numbers and passwords, as well as identity card details, among other information.
Chung also said Hongkongers’ awareness of fraudulent activities had improved, noting that not all calls to her office were requests for help from potential victims, as some were genuine inquiries about possible scams.
The privacy commissioner warned that scammers had a variety of methods for coaxing victims into providing personal data, such as impersonating someone they knew by hijacking instant messaging applications or creating deepfakes.
