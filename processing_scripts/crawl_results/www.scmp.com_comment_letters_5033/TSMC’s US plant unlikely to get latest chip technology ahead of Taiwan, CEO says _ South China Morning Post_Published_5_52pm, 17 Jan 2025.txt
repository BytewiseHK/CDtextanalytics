Apple and Nvidia chip supplier TSMC is spending US$65 billion on three giant factories in the state of Arizona
“Every step requires a permit, and after the permit is approved, it takes at least twice as long as in Taiwan,” Wei said late on Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. He added that it would therefore be hard for TSMC to use its latest technology in the US before Taiwan.
TSMC has said most of its chip manufacturing would remain in Taiwan, especially for the most advanced integrated circuits.
At an earnings conference on Thursday, Wei said he was confident the Arizona factory would produce the same quality of chips as in Taiwan, despite various challenges and cost overruns. He also expected a smooth ramp-up process.
