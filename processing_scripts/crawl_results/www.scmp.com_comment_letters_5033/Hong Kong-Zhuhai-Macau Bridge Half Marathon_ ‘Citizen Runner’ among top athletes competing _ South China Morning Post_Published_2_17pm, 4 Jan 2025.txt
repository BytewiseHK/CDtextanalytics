The Bank of China Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon is set to welcome elite runners, such as Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi and Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha Tolosa, among the 8,000 athletes taking part on Sunday.
The participants, who will be divided into those in Challenge Races and in non-Challenge Races, will run a section of the world’s longest cross-sea bridge and tunnel in an event that has been upgraded to a Gold Label Road Race by the World Athletics Federation.
Kawauchi gained fame by winning the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner, earning the title of “The Citizen Runner”.
“I am delighted to be in Hong Kong for this competition. The vibrant cityscape and stunning natural scenery of Hong Kong are truly impressive,” Kawauchi said.
“I can appreciate the energy of Hong Kong and the passion of its runners, and I am very much looking forward to not only taking part in this exciting event but also seizing the opportunity to explore Hong Kong and personally experience its unique charm where Eastern and Western cultures converge.”
Tolosa has a personal best marathon time of two hours, three minutes and 17 seconds. His best half-marathon time is 58:58, achieved at the Copenhagen Half Marathon in 2022.
