Scheme rewarding whistle-blowers who report ineligible tenants of Hong Kong housing meant for less well-off must be used fairly
The abuse of Hong Kongâ€™s public housing system by wealthy, ineligible tenants is a long-standing and serious problem that must be tackled. Progress has been made following a requirement that residents declare their assets and income every two years.
This led directly to 2,800 flats being recovered in the 2023-24 financial year.
Now that the most obvious cases have been dealt with, the government is keen to root out remaining offenders. With that in mind, a reward scheme for informers who provide valid tip-offs is to be launched on Wednesday.
The scheme, which will provide a HK$3,000 (US$385) reward for those who provide concrete evidence leading to a flat being reclaimed, is a step forward. It is expected to lead to a doubling in the number of tip-offs.
But the programme must be handled with great care to ensure it is not abused by those with grudges against their neighbours, undermining social harmony on housing estates.
Public housing is a limited resource reserved for the low-income members of society most in need of it. The eligibility criteria must be strictly enforced.
