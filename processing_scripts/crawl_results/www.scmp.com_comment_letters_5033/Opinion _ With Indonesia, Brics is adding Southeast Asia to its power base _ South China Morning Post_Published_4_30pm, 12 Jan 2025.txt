With Indonesia joining the grouping and Malaysia and Thailand as partner countries, Brics has acquired not just mineral-rich members but also key Asean voices
As countries in the West reorient supply chains in the name of national security, Global South countries are collaborating to align their policies and build their own reliable supply chains for critical minerals and related technologies and industries. For Brics, the addition of Southeast Asian countries is significant: the region is home to vast deposits of critical minerals and resources.
Joining Brics allows these countries to coordinate their policies and build consensus to secure critical supply chains while resisting Western pressure to adopt strategies that may conflict with their national or regional interests.
