World’s top maker of EV batteries is considering a second listing in Hong Kong that could help it raise at least US$5 billion
Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL) is poised to hire Bank of America, China International Capital Corporation (CICC), CSC Financial and JPMorgan Chase as lead arrangers for a second listing in Hong Kong this year, according to people familiar with the matter.
Other banks are likely to be added for what could be one of the largest offerings in Hong Kong in recent years, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private.
Considerations are ongoing, and details such as the size of any offering, line-up of banks and timeline may change, the people said.
Representatives for CATL, Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment, while CICC and CSC, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The company, along with Tencent Holdings, was recently blacklisted by the US for alleged links to the Chinese military. CATL said in a statement that it is not engaged in any military-related activities.
