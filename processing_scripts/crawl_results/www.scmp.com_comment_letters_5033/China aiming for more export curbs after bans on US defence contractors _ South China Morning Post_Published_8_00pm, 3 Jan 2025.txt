Proposed extended restrictions from commerce ministry come on the heels of dual-use export bans on 28 US defence contractors
The annual export control catalogue was issued on Thursday, the same day the ministry placed dozens of US defence contractors on an export bans list.
These include some technology to produce batteries with lithium iron phosphate (LFP), as well as phosphate-based cathode materials, according to the catalogue.
Cathode materials play a crucial role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries, extensively used in EVs.
