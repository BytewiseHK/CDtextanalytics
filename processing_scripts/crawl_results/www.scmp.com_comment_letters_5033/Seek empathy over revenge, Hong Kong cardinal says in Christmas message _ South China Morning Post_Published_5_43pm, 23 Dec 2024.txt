City’s top Catholic priest Stephen Chow says renewed hope needed despite Hong Kong’s sluggish economy and rise in mental health cases
Hong Kong’s top Catholic priest has called for the pursuit of justice through empathy instead of vengeance, while urging renewed hope in the local and global economy in his Christmas message.
Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan, head of the Catholic diocese of Hong Kong, on Monday invited the faithful to await the “promise of joy and hope of Christmas”, despite the “depressive and anxiety-provoking realities”.
He acknowledged the challenges facing city and the world, including the slower-than-expected economic recovery, increasingly tense geopolitics and rising mental health problems among the young and elderly.
But Chow said with “hope and love in our consciousness”, love could be brought to marginalised communities, who were struggling with feeling unwanted and abandoned.
They included prisoners waiting for a new life, married couples who could not see a sufficiently stable future for childbearing, young people who failed to identify convincing reasons to be hopeful about the future, and elderly residents who were lonely and abandoned, among others.
“It is in our best interest, and that of future generations, when we can help the weaker parties to become stronger so that together we can have a better present and a hope-filled future,” he said.
