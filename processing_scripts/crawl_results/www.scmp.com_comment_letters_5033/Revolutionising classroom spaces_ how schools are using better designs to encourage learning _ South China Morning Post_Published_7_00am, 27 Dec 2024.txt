From adaptable furniture to outdoor learning experiences, the teaching environment is being transformed to better meet the needs of today’s learners
Much thought and planning now goes into the design of classroom environments as it is important to create the right blend of social and instructional elements to spark interest and curiosity in young learners.
Some items have become standard – colours, flexible spaces, quiet areas and a choice of toys to use at break time. But while giving children the opportunity to start exploring their potential and learn about the world around them, each school also has to keep things fresh and move with the times.
These days, that means finding a suitable place for more technology in classrooms for even the youngest pupils. And, just as importantly, it means adopting approaches to learning that encourage the qualities society now values, such as collaboration, creativity and confidence.
At International College Hong Kong–Hong Lok Yuen (ICHKHLY), which has kindergarten and primary sections, a key aim is to provide a warm and welcoming space where children feel safe and secure.
This helps to bring out each pupil’s natural curiosity, and being able to move furniture – and even walls when required – adds to the general sense of inquiry.
“Our space is used to allow children autonomy in their learning,” says Holly Ayonote, kindergarten principal at ICHKHLY. “Certain areas are designed for collaboration, whether in construction or role play, but there are also places for those who want to engage in individual play or find somewhere quiet where they can regulate their emotions.”
