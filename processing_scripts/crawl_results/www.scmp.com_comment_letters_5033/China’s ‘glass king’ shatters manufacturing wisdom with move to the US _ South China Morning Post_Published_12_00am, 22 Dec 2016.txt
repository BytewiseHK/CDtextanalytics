AfterbuyingOhio plant,Cao Dewang warns China is losing its traditional manufacturing advantage
Cao Dewang became a billionaire by making glass for the world’s top carmakers, but his recent decision to move part of his operations to the United States has some asking whether the days of China as a manufacturing haven are over.
InThe Beijing Newson Monday, Fuyao Glass chairman Cao, 70, was quoted as saying the US was a cheaper and better place to make glass because taxes were much lower than in China. His comments come as some companies are reconsidering their ­presence in China, and as US president-elect Donald Trump is trying to lure firms back to the US under his “Make America Great Again” slogan.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government is levying higher taxes and increasing social welfare payment obligations on companies, making it harder to run a factory.
“I just told the truth and spoke out about the problems,” Cao said, explaining his decision to ­invest US$1 billion in the US, including taking over a former ­General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio.
He said manufacturing businesses in the mainland paid about 35 per cent more in taxes than their counterparts in the US, and value-added tax had become the biggest burden for companies.
Ironically, the central government has tried to portray its VAT reform as a tax-cutting move, saying it translated into a 500 billion yuan (HK$558 billion) reduction in burdens on businesses.
But according to Cao, the high taxation rates have made profits in manufacturing “very thin”.
