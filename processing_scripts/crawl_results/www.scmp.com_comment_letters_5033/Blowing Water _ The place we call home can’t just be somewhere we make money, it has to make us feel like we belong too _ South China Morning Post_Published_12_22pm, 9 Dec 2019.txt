We all have different opinions as to what makes a city liveable, be it quality of life, general lifestyle, or social interaction. But when it comes to defining what makes a place a home, there are some fundamentals that cannot be compromised, such as safety, happiness, and a sense of belonging.
The city we call home is more than just a place to live and work; it is an extension of ourselves. And we need to feel we belong and comfortable enough to settle down or maybe raise a family.
We might have grown up in one city but moved to another place, which can eventually become our new home where we continue to grow and develop as individuals because it makes us feel enjoyable, safe, respected, valued, and allowed us to interact with others to become part of the larger community.
According to InterNations, an expat networking website with 3.5 million members, the city has lost its preferred status among those looking for places to live because of its exorbitant housing prices, high cost of living, and a severe lack of work-life balance. Other complaints included dirty streets and high pollution.
