The period of the Great Leap Forward, the People’s Communes and the Anti-Rightist Campaign from 1957 to 1962 may be a bygone era the Chinese leadership prefers to leave unmentioned because of its devastating consequences.
To brook no dissent, Mao also launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign to target the official elites and intellectuals who had doubts or criticisms about his policies and labelled them “bourgeois” and sympathisers of the Western ideals.
Mao’s irrational and misguided policies, fanned by extreme ultra-left nationalism, produced catastrophic results: industrial output and grain production fell sharply and millions of people died in famine during the period although the natural disasters of drought and floods also played a role.
