The worldâ€™s largest chip foundry ended its relationship with a Singapore-based firm after a client review
Chinese tech champion Huawei has been under a blanket ban by the US since 2020 that effectively cuts off its access to semiconductor foundries worldwide. TSMC previously said it had not supplied products to Huawei since 2020. Huawei said it had not produced any chips via TSMC after the US implemented relevant sanctions.
Sophgo and its affiliate, bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain, have denied any business relationships with Huawei.
The Post is unable to reach PowerAIR, which does not have an official website, nor any publicly-listed phone number or email address. TSMC and Huawei did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
