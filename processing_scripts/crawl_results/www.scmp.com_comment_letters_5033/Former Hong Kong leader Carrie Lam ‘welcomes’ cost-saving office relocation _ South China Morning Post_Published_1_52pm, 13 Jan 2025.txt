Office spokesman confirms move from prime commercial building with annual rent of HK$5.67 million to government premises for next three years
Confirming an exclusive Post report, the Office of Former Chief Executives said on Monday that Lam’s current workplace at One Pacific Place in Admiralty would be relocated to the 23rd floor of Immigration Tower in Wan Chai when the three-year lease expired in May.
“Mrs Lam welcomes the relocation, which will save recurrent rental cost while at the same time enable her to continue discharging the former chief executive’s duties,” a spokesman for the office said.
“We expect the relocation to take place as soon as essential renovation works of the Immigration Tower premises have been completed, which should be well before the expiry of the current lease in May 2025.
“We have been advised that the Immigration Tower premises are available for use for at least three years.”
A spokesman for the Administration Wing also confirmed the Post’s report, saying the renovation work was in progress and the relocation date and opening arrangements would be announced in due course.
