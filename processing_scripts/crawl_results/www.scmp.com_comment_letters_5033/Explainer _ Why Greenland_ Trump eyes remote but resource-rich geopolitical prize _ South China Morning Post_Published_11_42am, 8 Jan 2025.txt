US President-elect Donald Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland
Remote, icy and mostly pristine, Greenland plays an outsize role in the daily weather experienced by billions of people and in the climate changes taking shape all over the planet.
Greenland is where climate change, scarce resources, tense geopolitics and new trade patterns all intersect, said Ohio University security and environment professor Geoff Dabelko.
The world’s largest island is now “central to the geopolitical, geoeconomic competition in many ways,” partly because of climate change, Dabelko said.
