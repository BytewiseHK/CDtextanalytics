Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office says Sam’s election fully reflects wide recognition of his character, philosophy, abilities and style
Former top judge Sam Hou-fai won an uncontested election to emerge as Macau’s new leader on Sunday as Beijing lauded him for being a unifier and reformer, making him an ideal chief executive for the city’s next stage of development.
The chief executive-elect received 394 votes from the 400-strong Election Committee in an hour-long poll. With four blank ballots cast and two absentees, Sam won the backing of 98.5 per cent of eligible voters.
In comparison, his predecessor Ho Iat-seng secured 392 out of 400 votes in the 2019 election, with seven blank ballots.
Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Sam’s election reflected the wide recognition of his character, philosophy, abilities and style.
It also listed six attributes the Macau people had identified in the chief executive-elect, saying the community also had these expectations of him as the gaming hub entered the next stage of its development.
The list of strengths comprises a firm love of the country and Macau, acting as a good unifier and team player, a focus on development with pragmatism, prioritising people’s livelihoods, a willingness to uphold national security, and the promotion of innovation and a willingness to make bold breakthroughs.
