Asia’s best hope is that the transactional side of the incoming US president wins out and he strikes a grand bargain with China
Given Trump’s obsession with bilateral trade balances, Asian economies are in the firing line. According to Morgan Stanley, seven of the 10 economies with the largest trade surpluses with the US are in Asia. Moreover, Asian economies are much more trade-dependent – exports account for between 37 and 85 per cent of economic output in Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia – and are more sensitive to shifts in US monetary policy.
Several other factors increase Asia’s vulnerability to external shocks. First, economic activity in many countries remains below pre-pandemic levels. By contrast, output gaps – the difference between actual and potential output – in most economies excluding China were positive in 2017, giving the region “much more of a cushion to absorb a trade hit than it has now,” JPMorgan said.
