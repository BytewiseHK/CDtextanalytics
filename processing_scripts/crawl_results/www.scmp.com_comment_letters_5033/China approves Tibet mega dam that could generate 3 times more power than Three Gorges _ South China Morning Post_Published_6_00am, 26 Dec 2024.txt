Hydropower project on Yarlung Tsangpo River could get unprecedented investment to tackle daunting engineering challenges
The report did not specify when construction would begin, or where it would take place.
The Yarlung Tsangpo flows across the Tibetan Plateau, carving out the deepest canyon on Earth and falling a staggering 7,667 metres (25,154 feet), before reaching India, where it is known as the Brahmaputra River.
The dam will be built in one of the rainiest parts of mainland China.
