Department of Health says 40 Housing Authority staff among three food poisoning clusters linked to Golden Lilies International Banquet Hall
Hong Kong government employees were among 57 diners who suffered food poisoning after eating at a restaurant in Kowloon Bay earlier this month, the Post has learned, with the cases involving separate groups that dined at the venue over three days.
Health authorities said the three clusters comprised 28 men and 29 women, aged 25 to 91, who ate at the Golden Lilies International Banquet Hall on January 8, 9 and 12.
Their symptoms included abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and fever.
The Department of Health said on Wednesday that one of the clusters involved 20 men and 20 women who worked for the Housing Authority.
“The Centre for Health Protection is actively following up those affected in collaboration with the Hong Kong Housing Authority, and it cannot be ruled out that the number of affected persons may further increase,” a department spokesman said.
The Housing Department said the authority’s staff club had organised a dinner at the restaurant.
