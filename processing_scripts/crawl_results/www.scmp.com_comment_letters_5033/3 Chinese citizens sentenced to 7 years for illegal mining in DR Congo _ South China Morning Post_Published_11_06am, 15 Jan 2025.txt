The trial took place against a backdrop of increasing efforts to combat illegal mineral trafficking in the DRC
Three Chinese citizens were sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison and ordered to pay US$600,000 in fines for illegally exploiting mineral resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to court filings.
The ruling marks the first time foreign mineral brokers have been convicted for unauthorised mineral exploitation in the DRC without authorisation from Congolese authorities.
The defendants were also found guilty of fraud, money laundering and looting. It is unclear if they will remain in the eastern city of Bukavu, where they are held, or if they will be transferred elsewhere.
They were arrested on January 4 with 10 gold bars and US$400,000 in cash.
Lawyers for the defendants say they intend to appeal, claiming the judgment is unjustified.
“Our clients are not satisfied with the judgment,” Arsene Mwaka, one of the defendants’ lawyers, told Associated Press by telephone.
