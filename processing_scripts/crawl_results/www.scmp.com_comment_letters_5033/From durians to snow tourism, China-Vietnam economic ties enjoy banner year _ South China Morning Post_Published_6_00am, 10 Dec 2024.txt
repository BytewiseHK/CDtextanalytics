Brisker trade and new investments in factories and infrastructure among the fruits of pragmatic approach to relationship
What do durians, lobsters and snow have in common?
They are all delivering economic dividends during an upbeat year for China’s ties with Vietnam.
Off and on since the 1970s, ships from the two nations have faced off in disputed parts of the South China Sea, sparking occasional mishaps and strongly worded diplomatic declamations.
But this year, as people on the ground tell it, each side found the other’s economy too influential to ignore.
“The Chinese government has kept an open attitude,” said Ding Wei, chairman of the China Business Association’s branch in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s main financial centre.
“It’s willing to invest in Vietnam and wants to have economic ties with Vietnam.”
Stronger economic ties have borne fruit this year in high-level dialogue, brisker trade and new direct investments in factories and infrastructure.
