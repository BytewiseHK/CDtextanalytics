A lot of thought goes into being Asian-American these days. For me, this starts with a somewhat frenzied search for identity.
That said, for the first time in my life, I have found myself scrutinising the shades of what could be discrimination, bias or ignorance. Daily existence is now viewed through the lens of race/ethnicity, something completely foreign to me.
At the swimming pool, my ritual of greeting fellow swimmers with “good morning” elicited a“konnichiwa”from a woman. Before I could correct her, she disappeared. It seemed somewhat comical and yet it lingered a bit, an unappealing aftertaste.
“How do you say hello in Chinese?” a friend asked. “Ni hao,” I said. “It sounds like ‘yee haw’, what they say in Texas when they are drunk,” my friend joked. “It’sni hao,” I said, matter of fact. “Yee haw, yee haw,” they laughed. “Stop it,” I said, stunned at my anger. I have become hypersensitive.
