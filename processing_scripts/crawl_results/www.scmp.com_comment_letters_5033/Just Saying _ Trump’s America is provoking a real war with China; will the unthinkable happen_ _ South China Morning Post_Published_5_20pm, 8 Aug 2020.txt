“It is to one’s honour to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel,”Proverbs chapter 20, verse 3 advises those who are being provoked into a fight.
You don’t really have to follow the Scriptures to appreciate the wisdom in these words, but how immensely ironic to see the officially atheist Chinese Communist Party taking the “honourable” road in such a context while the Bible-thumping administration of US President Donald Trump adopts the role of the belligerent “fool” picking all the fights in its astonishingly provocative religious crusade against China.
The latest, senseless act of aggression from Washington, the self-anointed sheriff of the world, is the slapping of sanctions on Hong Kong’s leader and 10 other local and mainland Chinese officials as punishment for their part in enforcing the city’s sweeping new national security law.
By now, with the exception of America’s useful idiots, everyone and their mum knows all this has nothing to do with protecting human rights in Hong Kong and everything to do with provoking Beijing by attacking this city, China’s weakest link.
Beijing’s top representative here, Luo Huining, had a fitting reply, mockingly offering to send US$100 across to Trump to freeze in the absence of any other assets he owns there.
