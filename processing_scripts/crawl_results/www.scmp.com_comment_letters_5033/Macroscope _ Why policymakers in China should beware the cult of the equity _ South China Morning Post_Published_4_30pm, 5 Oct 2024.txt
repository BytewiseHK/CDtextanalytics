Relying on a stock market bubble to quickly create economic growth is tempting but such an approach seldom ends well
Are stock markets in major Asian nations, like those in the West, in danger of becoming masters rather than servants of their economies? The question has come to the fore lately in China and Japan as these markets increasingly dominate policy, with far-reaching potential consequences.
