Some industry observers, however, say the recent Indian general election in which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost its majority could spur more celebrities to speak up on issues in general.
Among the Bollywood celebrities who have voiced support for Palestinians were Madhuri Dixit, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Varun Dhawan, Dia Mirza and Sonakshi Sinha.
However, in the face of heavy trolling with some users referring to oppressed Hindus in South Asia, several Bollywood stars such as Madhuri Dixit who posted during the “Eyes on Rafah” campaign deleted their social media accounts.
