Denial of refunds, unclear arrangements for meeting performers and obstructed views among cases received by Consumer Council
Hong Kong’s Consumer Council has received more than 500 complaints regarding public performances in the first 10 months of the year, and urged organisers to deliver on their advertising promises and offer concertgoers considerate rearrangements when there were unexpected changes.
The consumer watchdog said on Friday the complaints included issues such as denial of refunds despite unforeseen changes, unclear wording for fan meet-and-greet arrangements and obstruction of attendees’ view by show equipment.
Victor Lam Hoi-cheung, chairman of the council’s publicity and community relations committee, said that while Hong Kong was renowned as an event capital and the government had been promoting the mega-event economy, the watchdog had received more complaints so far this year than the same period in 2023.
“The council urges the industry to maintain transparency in event promotions by clearly highlighting any restrictions and risks, thereby empowering consumers to make informed decisions,” he said.
“While organisers should strive to deliver on their advertised promises, if changes are necessary due to unexpected circumstances, they should promptly inform affected consumers and offer considerate, flexible rearrangements.”
He also urged consumers to be aware that a ticket usually covered an entire event, and changes to individual segments of a show might not warrant a refund request.
