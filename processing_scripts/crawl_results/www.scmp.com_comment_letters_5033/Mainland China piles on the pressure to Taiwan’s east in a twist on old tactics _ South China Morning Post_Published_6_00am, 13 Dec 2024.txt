Data compiled from the Taiwanese defence ministry’s daily briefings shows a rise in drone and helicopter activity on the far side of the island
To the Taiwanese military, the island’s east has long been considered a safe haven – with the natural barriers of terrain and its position at the furthest reach from mainland China’s looming military pressure on the western coast, facing the Taiwan Strait.
Over the past 18 months, the PLA has deployed more helicopters, combat aircraft and drones to the island’s eastern seaboard, according to data compiled by the South China Morning Post from the Taiwanese defence ministry’s daily reports.
The ministry provides details of the number of PLA aircraft and vessels near Taiwan every day, including the number of aircraft entering Taiwan’s de facto air defence identification zone, and the activity areas of different aircraft types.
