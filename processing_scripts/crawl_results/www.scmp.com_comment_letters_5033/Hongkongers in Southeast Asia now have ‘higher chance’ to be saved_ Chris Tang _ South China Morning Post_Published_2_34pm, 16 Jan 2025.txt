Security chief vows to spare no effort to bring scam victims home, as he urges families to report ransom calls
Hongkongers detained in Southeast Asia now have a higher chance of being rescued, the security chief has said, vowing the government will spare no effort to bring them back despite challenges.
Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung on Thursday also urged victims’ families to immediately report any ransom calls to avoid being deceived again.
Hong Kong government officials are expected later in the day to meet families of the 12 residents who were lured into working at scam farms in Southeast Asian countries.
Earlier this week, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk Hau-yip led a task force on a two-day trip to Thailand, with local authorities sharing intelligence, including how to rescue those 12.
“Unlike before, staff from the Hong Kong side now have direct contact with supervisors in the region who are in charge of the rescue … That helps a lot in enhancing efficiency and staying on the same page for collaboration,” Tang said in a television interview.
“Meanwhile, Thai authorities are also committed to the rescue. With devotion from both sides, I think the detained Hongkongers have a much higher chance to come back home.”
