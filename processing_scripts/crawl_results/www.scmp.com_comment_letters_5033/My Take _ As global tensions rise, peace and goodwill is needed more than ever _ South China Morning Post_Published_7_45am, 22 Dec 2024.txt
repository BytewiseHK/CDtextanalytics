The Christmas spirit has universal appeal and has, in different ways, been embraced by people of other faiths and beliefs around the world
Santa will not be the only visitor given a warm welcome in Hong Kong this Christmas. The city is hoping to attract hordes of tourists to enjoy its festive attractions, providing much-needed winter fuel for the frosty economy.
There has been an encouraging start to the season, with new, more liberal, visa arrangements for residents of neighbouring Shenzhen prompting a flood of holidaymakers from the mainland.
The Star Ferry and Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront were packed with visitors last weekend. The airport, meanwhile, is expecting to welcome 200,000 arrivals a day.
It is hoped the influx will provide welcome relief for Hong Kong’s beleaguered retail sector. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has been trying to set an example, making surprise visits to Christmas attractions. He even spent HK$1,600 on 38 stuffed pandas at a festive fair.
Lee has encouraged local people to seize the “golden opportunities” offered by the influx of tourists from across the border, while urging them to treat the visitors nicely and ensure they have a good experience. The city should certainly be rolling out the red carpet.
Hong Kong has, since long before the pandemic, offered visitors an attractive and alternative destination for Christmas, whether they come from the mainland or further afield.
