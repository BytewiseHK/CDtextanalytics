In an unprecedented move, Beijing has announced corruption investigations into two former defence ministers.
Earlier meetings of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the country’s top military decision-making body, also stripped Li and Wei of their positions as generals and membership of the People’s Liberation Army, it added.
The investigation into Li began on August 31 and concluded that he had accepted “large sums of money” to seek benefits for others. He had also bribed others, according to the statement.
Wei came under investigation on September 21 and is accused of accepting unauthorised gifts and large amounts of money in exchange for using his power to obtain benefits for others. He is not accused of taking bribes.
