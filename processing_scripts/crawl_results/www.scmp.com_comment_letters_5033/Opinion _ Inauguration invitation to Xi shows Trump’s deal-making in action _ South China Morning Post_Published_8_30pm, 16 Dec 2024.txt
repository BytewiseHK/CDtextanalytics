The US president-elect’s overture to China’s leader shows he doesn’t want to be as confrontational as his messaging and advisers suggest
Trump’s diplomatic overture marks a departure from decades of US policy, which has long refrained from inviting foreign leaders to presidential inaugurations. The gesture signals that the incoming administration, and Trump in particular, views China as a top priority. It reflects Trump’s desire to build on his personal relationship with Xi.
His recent actions and somewhat cryptic messaging on China indicate he is interested in working out an agreeable deal with Beijing and wants to leave a door open for bargains as any seasoned businessman would.
Over the weekend, I reached out to Denis Simon, a distinguished China scholar and non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute in Washington, to help me understand why Trump invited Xi.
