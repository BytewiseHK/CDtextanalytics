President urges city to embrace reforms, attract a broad pool of talent and increase its presence on the global stage
Chinese President Xi Jinping has laid down his expectations for Macau during a visit to the city to swear in its next leader, calling on it to avoid complacency, strive to attract a broad range of talent and play a bigger role on the international stage.
At the same time, Xi praised the city for the orderly development of its gaming industry, the biggest in the world, as well as its efforts to diversify its economic base.
The president outlined his vision for Macau in a speech at a gala dinner at the East Asian Games Dome on Thursday, attended by Sam Hou-fai, who will be inaugurated as the city’s fourth chief executive on Friday, and Hong Kong leader John Lee Ka-chiu.
Xi’s wife, Peng Liyuan, and current Macau leader Ho Iat-seng also attended the dinner.
The president’s visit also marks the 25th anniversary of Macau’s return to Chinese rule.
Among the president’s three expectations for Macau, “embracing a broader vision” was at the top of the list. He called on the casino hub to “keep pace with the trends of the times” and further refine its vision for the future.
