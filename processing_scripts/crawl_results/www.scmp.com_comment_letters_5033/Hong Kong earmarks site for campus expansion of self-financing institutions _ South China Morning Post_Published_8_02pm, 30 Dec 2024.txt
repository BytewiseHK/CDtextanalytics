1,210 square metre plot is currently a public car park near the former campus owned by the operator of the city’s first Catholic university
Hong Kong education authorities have reserved a 1,210 square metre site in Sha Tin that self-financing institutions can apply for to expand their campuses in early 2026.
The site, which is now a public car park, is located next to a former campus owned by the operator of Hong Kong’s first Catholic university.
The Education Bureau said on Monday it was offering the Sha Tin site and an interest-free loan scheme for the development of a university campus and student hostels, as part of plans to support the sector.
“To further support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of the self-financing sector, the government has launched a series of support measures for self-financing institutions in developing and enhancing their campuses, and developing their niche areas,” the bureau said.
The site is currently leased as a fee-paying public car park under a short-term tenancy agreement that can be terminated with three months’ notice, according to the government.
Located along Man Lai Road in Sha Tin, the site is next to the former campus of the Caritas Institute of Community Education and the Caritas Shatin Marden Foundation Secondary School before they closed in 2020 and 2008, respectively.
The operator of the former campus, Caritas Hong Kong, obtained government approval to turn its self-financing institution, Caritas Institute of Higher Education, into the city’s first Catholic university, Saint Francis University (SFU), early this year.
