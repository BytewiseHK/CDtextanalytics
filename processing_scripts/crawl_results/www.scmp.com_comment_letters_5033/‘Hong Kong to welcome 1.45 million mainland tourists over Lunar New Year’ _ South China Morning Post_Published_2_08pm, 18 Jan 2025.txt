Travel Industry Council chairman says he expects 15 per cent rise from last year’s festive period thanks to mega-events, relaxed visa rules
Hong Kong will welcome 1.45 million mainland Chinese visitors to the city over the Lunar New Year period, about 15 per cent more than in 2024, a travel industry leader has forecast, citing a slew of mega-events and recently relaxed visa restrictions.
The Travel Industry Council’s new chairman, Tommy Tam Kwong-shun, shared his prediction with the Post earlier this week for the number of mainland travellers set to visit the city from January 28 to February 4.
The number represents an increase of about 15 per cent from the 1.255 million mainland visitors recorded by the Immigration Department during last year’s festivities.
The department is expected to reveal its forecast for the coming Lunar New Year period sometime next week.
“Hong Kong has several mega-events during this time, and the atmosphere will be great,” Tam said.
“In addition, the multiple entry scheme will definitely help; we are seeing a lot of momentum in this regard this time.”
