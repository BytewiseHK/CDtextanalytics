US-China ties are at “a historical low” but the experience of Tesla and Fuyao Glass show there is still room for cooperation, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told a high-profile annual conference in Beijing.
“The main cause of the current predicament is that the United States regards China as its most important strategic competitor and a major geopolitical challenge, and is engaged in economic decoupling and technological containment,” Qin told the forum on Monday.
The three-day event, organised each year by the State Council’s Development Research Centre, began on Saturday – its first offline edition since the Covid-19 pandemic began.
