Setting up exhibits at terminals and making sure cruise ships sail in a certain direction to maximise views are among suggestions
The list of complaints ran from poor transport connectivity for passengers to losing Disneyland Cruise Line to Singapore and the wider reluctance of operators in making Hong Kong their home port.
“It is possible that we may aim for a certain number of docking days within a year,” said Rosanna Law Shuk-pui, the new secretary for culture, sports and tourism.
“Or the companies bidding for the contract may suggest or promise how many days they are confident they can secure for cruise ships to dock. These are also important indicators.
“It’s important to have [more cruises] here both as a home port or a port within a longer route. It will be too late to tender in 2027 for a contract that runs out in 2028. The timetables for cruise companies to dock and the deployment of vessels take two to three years to plan.”
