Emergency responders have rescued two hikers trapped by a hill fire that raged for more than four hours in Hong Kong’s Yuen Long.
Police said they were alerted to the fire at Kai Kung Leng, a mountain range in Lam Tsuen Country Park, at about 5.30pm on Saturday.
A subsequent report was received around 6.30pm about two hikers – a man and a woman – who were stranded in the same area due to the fire and strong wind.
The two started hiking at around 3pm. They were rescued by members of the Government Flying Service from the top of a mountain, with neither hurt.
According to the Fire Services Department, the line of the blaze had grown to 80 metres (262 feet) in the evening. It was still burning as of 10pm.
