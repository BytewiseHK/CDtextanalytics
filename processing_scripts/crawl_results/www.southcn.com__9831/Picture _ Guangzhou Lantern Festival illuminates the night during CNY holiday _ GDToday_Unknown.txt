On January 16, the opening of the 2025 Guangzhou Spring Festival Lantern Festival, which is the largest lantern festival in South China showcasing Lingnan Cantonese culture, illuminated the night.
The ancient Yuexiu Mountain has been adorned with countless lanterns, creating a breathtaking scene of brilliance and splendor. A giant phoenix crown shines with radiant colors, while a hundred-meter-long koi fish lantern adds a majestic touch. The Treasure Basin overflows with golden oranges, symbolizing prosperity, and the poetic city of Guangzhou, whispers tales of the past and present.
The lantern festival, with the theme "Blossoms in Yuexiu, Encountering the Koi," integrates World Intangible Cultural Heritage, Lingnan culture, poetic Guangzhou, lantern art, and modern technology. It will run until February 16 and provide a unique audio-visual and cultural feast. Residents and tourists can admire flowers in the daytime while enjoying lanterns at night.
