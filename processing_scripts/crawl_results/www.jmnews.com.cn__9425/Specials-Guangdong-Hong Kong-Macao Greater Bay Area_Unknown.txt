The third session of the 14th Guangdong Provincial People's Congress opened on January 15. At the first plenary meeting, the Governor of Guangdong delivered the Provincial government work report, summarizing the province's achievements over the past year and outlining plans for the year ahead.
A key highlight from the report reveals that Guangdong's GDP is expected to surpass the milestone of 14 trillion yuan, reaffirming its position as the nation's leader for 36 consecutive years. The report also highlights that the province has led the nation in total import and export volume for 39 consecutive years.
What aspects of this report should catch the attention of foreign audiences? And what insights can we draw from it about Guangdong's economic performance? GDToday spoke with the consuls general who attended the session and listened to the report firsthand to gain their perspectives.
