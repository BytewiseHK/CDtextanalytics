The construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the GBA) is a national-level strategy proposed and implemented by Chinese President Xi Jinping. It's a move to provide a new model of comprehensive opening up and also a new practice of 'One Country, Two Systems'.
The GBA consists of the Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, and nine cities in Guangdong (namely Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing) with a total area of 56,000 square kilometers. By the end of 2020, the region's population had reached over 80 million. It is one of the regions with high openness, strong economy and strategic importance in China.
Featuring regional advantages, strong economy, innovation power and advanced engagement with international businesses, the GBA will become a dynamic world-class city cluster, a global technology and innovation hub, a key component of Belt and Road initiative, a showcase for in-depth cooperation between the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as an ideal place for living, working and traveling.
