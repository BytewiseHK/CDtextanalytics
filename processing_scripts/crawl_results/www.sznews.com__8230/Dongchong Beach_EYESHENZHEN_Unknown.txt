One of the most beautiful beaches in Shenzhen, Dongchong Beach in Dapeng New District is located on the southeasternmost edge of Shenzhen’s coastline. Travelers can enjoy great sea views and feast on a wide selection of seafood in the village near the beach. They can also go hiking along the mountains to Xichong Beach. There’s also a mangrove wetland park near the beach for travelers to explore.
During peak seasons and major public holidays, self-driving tourists are required to make reservations to enter the Dapeng Peninsula. We kindly request that all visitors follow the instructions of the traffic police and make reservations during these periods of time.
