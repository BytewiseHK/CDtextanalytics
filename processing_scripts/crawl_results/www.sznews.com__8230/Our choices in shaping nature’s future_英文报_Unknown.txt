THE primary goal of this column is to inform individuals about ecosystem functionality, associated risks, and methods for managing ecosystems. While it is commonly assumed that ecological information alone can guide sound decision-making in the face of current and future challenges, in reality, decisions are often heavily influenced by development goals, neglecting ecological factors. Throughout Shenzhen’s development, particularly around the Shenzhen Bay area, choices have been heavily influenced by development objectives, without considering the functional structures — boundaries and natural corridors — of ecosystems.However, as our understanding of ecosystems grows, both successful initiatives and past errors should be made public to better guide protection, restoration, and optimal ecological function.Ecosystems can be likened to financial portfolios, where the combined properties of aggregate systems tend to be less volatile than their individual components. The “portfolio” concept when applied to ecosystems provides insights into how ecosystems are supposed to be organized, how species interact, and how evolutionary strategies develop. It also provides a framework for managing risks posed by inevitable disturbances, many of which may be unpredictable.EcoBites, through its provision of ecological information, explores the collective organization of ecosystems and the values of people, all of which need to be integrated into the engineered design of nature, ideally mirroring nature’s optimal conditions. The main challenge lies in aligning “ecological norms,” as defined by natural ecohydrological portfolios, with social norms to promote collective goods. This can be achieved through methods like education via mass media, as what we’re doing with EcoBites. Then, it's crucial to update ecological information continuously, as our understanding of nature is limited at any given time. For example, the importance of coastal wetlands in the carbon cycle was not widely recognized 40 years ago when the ecology of Dasha River Delta was compromised.Monitoring ecosystem changes is essential for updating our knowledge of fundamental ecological processes, which should be disseminated not only through school education but also via media and nature centers. A continuous, widespread understanding fosters social progress, aligning individual behavior with broader ecological goals. Ultimately, in considering climate perspectives, our choices shape the climate we desire.Embracing an eco-engineering perspective necessitates aligning the assembly of nature’s “Lego pieces” with both our needs and desires while remaining feasible and optimal within the natural realm grounded in the salient ecohydrological architecture of ecosystems. Individual components like buildings or species can no longer be viewed in isolation.Moving beyond mere protection and restoration, ecosystem engineering offers a clear detailed roadmap for sustainable global development. Integrated top-down and bottom-up decision-making, based on widespread ecological knowledge, guides our choices. Essentially, the choices we make form the foundational ecology.(Matteo Convertino)
