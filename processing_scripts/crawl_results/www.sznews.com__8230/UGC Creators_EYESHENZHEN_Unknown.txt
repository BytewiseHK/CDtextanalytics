In this hyperconnected world, everyday individuals like you and me can create content and share it with family, friends, and even a larger audience. Even without being a big-name celebrity or influencer, we can produce content based on our personal experiences, interests, or expertise and make an impact. We have this "UGC Creators" column to invite our expat readers from all over the world to share their encounters and perspectives on Shenzhen or the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We see this as a chance to listen to and interact with our readers. Those interested in creating freelance content can contact us at eyeshenzhen@126.com. Can't wait to hear from you!
