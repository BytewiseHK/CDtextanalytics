Porcelain lovers can admire a rich assortment of elegant and exquisite Chinese porcelains produced in imperial kilns from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century at the "Refined Radiance of Imperial Porcelain" exhibition at Nanshan Museum.
The 100 exhibits, on loan from the Liaoning Provincial Museum in Shenyang, Northeast China, were produced during the reigns of Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), a golden era when Chinese porcelain craftsmanship reached its pinnacle.

Under the reigns of the three emperors, marked by political stability, economic prosperity, and the court’s focus on porcelain production, both imperial and civilian kilns achieved unparalleled levels of artistry and technique finesse, showcasing exceptional creative talent and mastery of craftsmanship.
Most imperial porcelains in the Qing Dynasty were produced in Jingdezhen, known as the "porcelain capital." The city, in modern-day Jiangxi Province, boasts abundant raw materials for porcelain, such as porcelain stone, kaolin, glaze stone, glazed ash, and refractory soil.

At the exhibition, a range of porcelains, from blue-and-white to famille rose to various colored glaze pieces, not only showcase delicate textures, intricate designs, and exquisite craftsmanship but also reflect the aesthetic trends and innovations of the era.
Among the standout pieces are a pair of vases adorned with magnificent dragon and phoenix patterns, a set of 12 blue-and-white porcelain tea cups featuring elegant floral patterns and poems, and glazed porcelains in hues like green, white, blue, red, and yellow. Particularly noteworthy are the wares imitating the Song Dynasty (960-1279) Jun Kiln glazed wares in hues from grayish blue to a plum color, many strikingly splashed or mottled in purple or crimson.
