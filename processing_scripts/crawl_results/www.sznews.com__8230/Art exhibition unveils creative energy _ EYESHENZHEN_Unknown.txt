The vibrant spirit of creativity takes center stage at the Shenzhen Art Museum as the “Youth Vision — 2024 Shenzhen Youth Art Exhibition” is being held there starting Nov. 19.
Lasting until Jan. 5, 2025, this artistic extravaganza showcases the richness and diversity of youthful artistry, embracing a novel approach by intertwining the primary exhibition space with a parallel exhibition subvenue for the first time. With a sharp focus on emerging young talents and their dynamic works, the exhibition envisions a spirited and energized depiction of a “Youthful Shenzhen” through the lens of artistic expression.

Incepted in 2019, the exhibition represents a biennial tradition of youth-inspired showcases that welcome submissions from the public. It has grown into a significant platform, nurturing the creative voices of youthful artists.
Since 2021, the exhibition has centered its theme around the “Youth Vision,” offering a fresh outlook on the world through youthful eyes.
The latest edition not only expanded in scale but also introduced innovative structural elements, with close to 1,000 valid submissions primarily hailing from Shenzhen, alongside contributions from budding artists in Beijing, Shanghai, and even overseas.

After thorough evaluation by an expert panel, a curated selection of 100 art pieces, spanning diverse mediums such as traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, printmaking, sculpture, installations, film, and new media, was featured.
The exhibition features four prominent segments — “Future City,” “Technological Vision,” “Nature Wonders,” and “A Mind-wondering of Philosophy and Art.” These sections delve into the essence of young urban living, technological advancements, natural splendor, and philosophical introspections, respectively, offering a kaleidoscopic view of the vibrant city through creative expression.
In a groundbreaking move, a parallel exhibition debuted concurrently at the Pingshan District Exhibition Hall. Showcasing close to 60 distinctive works spanning traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, sculptures, printmaking, installations, mixed media, and film, this exhibition spotlights the significance of installation art. Serving as a robust complement to the primary showcase, the parallel exhibition represents a comprehensive expansion and enrichment of Shenzhen’s youth art ecosystem, offering emerging talents greater visibility and fostering enhanced exchange and dissemination of youthful artistry.
