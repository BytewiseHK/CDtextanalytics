Shenzhen aims to attract and retain overseas talent by implementing a series of talent introduction policies designed to support and benefit skilled professionals. These talent policies offer a range of incentives, including living allowances, housing support, and financial assistance. The living allowances are provided to newly introduced residents, including PhD graduates under 35 and graduates from renowned domestic and international universities, with specific amounts varying by region within Shenzhen. Housing support under Shenzhen's talent incentives addresses housing needs through affordable housing options and rental subsidies. Financial support within these Shenzhen talent incentives programs focuses on strengthening the financial ecosystem to foster and develop international financial talent.
Talents and their teams starting a business in Shenzhen can access various forms of financial supportincentives, including startup funds, loan incentives, and special subsidies. The government will provide different levels of startup subsidies for talents, such as up to 1 million yuan in funding, based on the size, industry, and innovation capabilities of the company. In addition, Shenzhen also provides a variety of policies, such as interest subsidies for startup loans and guidance for venture capital funds to help companies solve funding problems in the early stages of their startups. The application process for talents’ financial program engagement typically involves submitting a business plan, financial statements, and company registration documents. It is recommended to visit the official website of Shenzhen’s relevant departments to obtain more information and apply as required.
