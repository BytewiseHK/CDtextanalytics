LUXURY timepieces from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) are on display at the Guangdong Museum in the neighboring city of Guangzhou, where visitors can explore the fascinating origins of self-striking clocks and admire the brilliance of Qing Dynasty timepieces crafted in Guangzhou.This exhibition marks the largest showcase of Qing Dynasty Guangzhou-crafted clocks to date, running until April 6, 2025.Featuring over 110 exquisite Guangzhou clocks and related artifacts, the exhibition received substantial support from renowned institutions such as the Palace Museum, Chengde Mountain Resort Museum, the First Historical Archives of China, the Summer Palace, Guangzhou Museum, and the Guangdong Folk Art Museum.The exhibition is structured into three sections: “Scale of Time,” “Art of Time,” and “Temperature of Time.” Through a blend of intricate artifacts, historical archives, distinct Cantonese craftsmanship, and immersive multimedia digital displays, the exhibition provides a holistic view of the various dimensions and contemporary relevance of Qing Dynasty clocks, exploring the realms of “Craftsmanship Spirit,” “Chinese Ingenuity,” and “Cultural Exchange and Interaction.”The “Scale of Time” embarks on a journey through the evolution of timekeeping devices in China, reflecting on the clock diplomacy by Western missionaries, the flourishing trade of self-striking clocks during the eras of Kangxi and Qianlong emperors, to the gradual integration of clocks into Chinese society. This section delves into the historical background of Guangzhou clocks, their developmental trajectories, and the innovative essence of Guangzhou craftsmen.The “Art of Time” section delves into the fusion of Eastern and Western aesthetics, showcasing the intricate craftsmanship and unique characteristics of Guangzhou clocks through the lens of four key aspects: wooden clocks, bronze clocks, enamel clocks, and mechanical construction. .In the “Temperature of Time” segment, the focus shifts to the museum’s advancements in clock preservation and restoration, craft exploration, digital reconstruction and activation, as well as the continuity and progress of Guangzhou clock manufacturing techniques within the contemporary clockmaking industry in Guangdong.Integrating overarching narratives with individual perspectives, the exhibition incorporates modern design elements and employs AI interactive technologies to craft immersive experiences such as the “Pan Chun’s Workshop,” integrated projection showcases like “Clock Illusion,” 3D mapping projection artistry featuring the “Mechanical Structure of Guangzhou Clocks,” and interactive engagements like the “Time Secrets — Guangzhou Clock Assembly” game.(Shao Jingfeng)
