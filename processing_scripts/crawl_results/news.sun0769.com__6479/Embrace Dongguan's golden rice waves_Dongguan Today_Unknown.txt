As the sunny days brighten Dongguan, the city's golden rice fields are entering their final days of the season. The late rice harvest has begun, and nature lovers have only a short window to experience this stunning spectacle before it's gone until next year.
Hongmei Town
Nestled in Hongmei Town's Hongwuwo Village, the Golden Water Town Rice Field Park offers a perfect blend of natural beauty and rural charm. Surrounded by the picturesque Hongwuwo Canal, this ecological gem is a key feature of the town's riverfront living and environmental demonstration zone.
Currently, the park's rice fields have turned a rich golden hue, ready for harvest. Visitors are flocking to stroll among the golden waves, breathe in the fragrant air, and capture the idyllic countryside views. Birds flutter freely, adding life to the serene landscape, while the refreshing taste of "Hetaicao(禾胎草)" tea adds a unique local flavor to the experience.
Beyond the golden fields, the park offers lush green camping grounds, vibrant bridges, scenic lakes, and meandering greenways, creating a perfect escape into rural tranquility.
