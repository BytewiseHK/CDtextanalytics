Nearly 40 enterprises in Zhongshan went to Hong Kong for the 51st Hong Kong Toys & Games Fair, the 16th Hong Kong Baby Products Fair and the 23rd Hong Kong International Stationery & School Supplies Fair held from January 6 to 9 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.
Innovative products by Zhongshan enterprises such as Baobaohao, Old Captain, Ronbei, Zetababy and Youyoubei were popular among merchants at the fairs.
Multiple enterprises received hundreds of new clients in the first two days, which was far beyond expectations. They hoped Zhongshan brands could be exposed to more new clients through the fairs, and they could secure more orders as well.
Zhongshan is an important baby product manufacturing hub in China with a complete industrial chain and quality products sold abroad.
