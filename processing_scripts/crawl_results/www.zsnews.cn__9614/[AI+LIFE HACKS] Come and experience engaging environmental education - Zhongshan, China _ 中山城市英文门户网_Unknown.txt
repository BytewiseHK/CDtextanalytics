The Northern Integrated Waste Treatment Base, located beside Wuzhu Mountain in Wulan Village, Huangpu Town, is a key facility for the harmless treatment of household waste in Zhongshan, as well as an environmental education base in Guangdong Province.
A nearly 2,000 square meter area dedicated to cyclic exhibitions creates an immersive and three-dimensional eco-friendly educational environment. To make the visit more fun, the exhibition hall features interactive screens showing the knowledge on garbage sorting, claw machines, and more. The dolls in the claw machines are specially designed in the shape of trash cans.
