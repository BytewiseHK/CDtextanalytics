"Look, a lot of dolphins there!" On January 6, white figures emerged from the water at the east Hengmen Waterway, amazing many tourists.
The majestic ShenZhong Link stands between the blue water and the sky. Seagulls swoop in groups to search for food, while Chinese white dolphins leap and play. Fishing boats, cruise ships and high-speed passenger ships shuttle back and forth. All these form a beautiful picture of harmonious coexistence of human and nature.
Known as the "panda at sea", the Chinese white dolphin is very sensitive to the marine water quality, serving as a living indicator of the marine ecosystem. Half a year after the opening of the ShenZhong Link, they come as promised, indicating that the marine ecological restoration of Zhongshan waters progresses well.
