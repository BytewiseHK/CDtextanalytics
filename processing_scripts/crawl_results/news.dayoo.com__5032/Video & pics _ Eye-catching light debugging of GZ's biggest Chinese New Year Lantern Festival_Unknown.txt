Among all the 75 sets of lanterns, the most eye-catching one was the main gate set, which is designed in the shape of a phoenix coronet in the Cantonese Opera. Cantonese Opera was inscribed on the World Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2009.

Lanterns in the images of fish, snake and a kumquat tree, which is an indispensable decoration for the Cantonese families during the Spring Festival, also captured a lot of attention.
