Anno Bernhard Dederichs said he was very happy to be among the first batch of foreigners to receive the entity card that combines the functions of work permit and social security in Guangzhou on January 15.
With the card, his work and life in Guangzhou would become much more convenient and smoother in the months to come, said the German professor from local Sun Yat-sen University.
The card was jointly issued for foreigners by Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology and Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Security.
Foreigners with the card can use it to handle their issues related with social security, medical treatment, transportation, cultural, tourism and financial consumption in the city, according to a statement released by Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology.
It will further promote the reform of service management for foreigners working and living in Guangzhou, allowing more foreign talents in Guangzhou to enjoy the convenience brought by the digital era, it added.
China has officially implemented the integration of foreigners' work permits and social security cards since December 1, 2024, the statement said.
Besides Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan cities have also awarded such entity cards to foreigners who work and live in the cities on January 15.
By uploading foreigners' work permit information into the social security card system, the new entity card aims to provide more convenient and efficient services for foreigners working and living in the country.
The latest version of the entity card integrates the functions of work permit information inquiry, social security card service voucher, payment and settlement, as well as salary distribution.
